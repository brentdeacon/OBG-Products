The most successful building yield the most points. Each player can also create works of art to increase his score.The action board is modular, with not every player having access to each action each turn. Some actions cost money - acquiring high-quality materials, building a level of your personal house, finding a patron, creating a work of art, selling that art for money and prestige - while other actions are free but can potentially cause you to lose one of your workers; these latter actions include acquiring low-quality materials, activating your patrons, visiting the stock exchange, and taking one of the actions with a cost. Once everyone has passed on taking more actions, the round ends and players have an art exhibition during which they can sell works. After this, players receive prestige points or bonus cards based on the symbols they&#39;ve placed their workers next to on the action board.After five rounds, the game ends and players score bonus points based on their architect level, their bonus cards, how well they&#39;ve completed their work, and their money on hand.

Like most people in dystopian fiction, your workers are oblivious to their situation. This world is all they&#39;ve ever known, and you may use them at your whim. The world as we know it has ended, and in its place the city of Euphoria has risen. Believing that a new world order is needed to prevent another apocalypse, the Euphorian elite erect high walls around their golden city and promote intellectual equality above all else. Gone are personal freedoms; gone is knowledge of the past. All that matters is the future. The Euphorians aren&rsquo;t alone. Outside the city are those who experienced the apocalypse firsthand&mdash;they have the memories and scars to prove it. These Wastelanders have cobbled together a society of historians and farmers among the forgotten scrap yards of the past. There is more to the world than the surface of the earth. Deep underground lies the hidden city of Subterra, occupied by miners, mechanics, and revolutionaries. By keeping their workers in the dark, they&rsquo;ve patched together a network of pipes and sewers, of steam and gears, of hidden passages and secret stairways. In Euphoria: Build a Better Dystopia, you lead a team of workers (dice) and recruits (cards) to claim ownership of the dystopian world. You will generate commodities, dig tunnels to infiltrate opposing areas, construct markets, collect artifacts, strengthen allegiances, and fulfill secret agendas. Euphoria is a worker-placement game in which dice are your workers. The number on each die represents a worker&#39;s knowledge &ndash; that is, his level of awareness that he&#39;s in a dystopia. Worker knowledge enables various bonuses and impacts player interaction. If the collective knowledge of all of your workers gets too high, one of them might desert you. You also have two elite recruit cards at your disposal; one has pledged allegiance to you, but the other needs some convincing. You can reveal and use the reticent recruit by reaching certain milestones in the game...or by letting other players unwittingly reach those milestones for you. Your path to victory is paved with the sweat of your workers, the strength of your allegiances, and the tunnels you dig to infiltrate other areas of the world, but the destination is a land grab in the form of area control. You accomplish this by constructing markets that impose harsh restrictions of personal freedoms upon other players, changing the face of the game and opening new paths to victory. You can also focus on gathering artifacts from the old world, objects of leisure that are extremely rare in this utilitarian society. The dystopian elite covet these artifacts &ndash; especially matching pairs &ndash; and are willing to give you tracts of land in exchange for them. Four distinct societies, each of them waiting for you to rewrite history. What are you willing to sacrifice to build a better dystopia?",https://t.cfjump.com/33917/p/33972529,http://www.ozgameshop.com/strategy-board-games/euphoria-build-a-better-dystopia?utm_source=commission+factory&amp;utm_medium=shopping&amp;utm_campaign=commission+factory+shopping+data+feed+(17/05/2017),http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33972529.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33972529@50x50.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33972529@100x100.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33972529@120x120.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33972529@200x200.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33972529@300x300.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33972529@400x400.jpg,94.49 AUD,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the game, you are the bearded leader of a small dwarf family that lives in a little cave in the mountains. You begin the game with a farmer and his spouse, and each member of the farming family represents an action that the player can take each turn. Together, you cultivate the forest in front of your cave and dig deeper into the mountain. You furnish the caves as dwellings for your offspring as well as working spaces for small enterprises. It&#39;s up to you how much ore you want to mine. You will need it to forge weapons that allow you to go on expeditions to gain bonus items and actions. While digging through the mountain, you may come across water sources and find ore and ruby mines that help you increase your wealth. Right in front of your cave, you can increase your wealth even further with agriculture: You can cut down the forest to sow fields and fence in pastures to hold your animals. You can also expand your family while running your ever-growing farm. In the end, the player with the most efficiently developed home board wins. You can also play the solo variant of this game to familiarize yourself with the 48 different furnishing tiles for your cave. Caverna: The Cave Farmers, which has a playing time of roughly 30 minutes per player, is a complete redesign of Agricola that substitutes the card decks from the former game with a set of buildings while adding the ability to purchase weapons and send your farmers on quests to gain further resources. Designer Uwe Rosenberg says that the game includes parts of Agricola, but also has new ideas, especially the cave part of your game board, where you can build mines and search for rubies. The game also includes two new animals: dogs and donkeys.

Players spread through the map in order to collect points at the end of the game by having majorities in regions and continents. All actions (such as land or sea movement, army production, or the founding of cities) are driven by cards that are face-up (six at a time) and available by increasing prices. Cards also contain resources, which also give points when the game ends if properly collected. Its first version was available as print-and-play, and a regular (Kickstarter funded) version was published in 2013. An expansion featuring a European map is available as an expansion (Eight-Minute Empire: Europe Expansion Board), and a stand-alone sequel has also been published (Eight-Minute Empire: Legends). From the publisher: Build an empire and conquer the land in around eight minutes! In Eight-Minute Empire, 2-5 players take turns selecting a card from six displayed. The card gives a good, and also has an action that the player takes immediately. Actions help players take over the map, but sets of goods are worth points at the end of the game, so players have to balance the two aspects. Eight-Minute Empire is the super-quick area control game with tough decisions.

Discard enough contagion cards to advance a mutation to the next level, thereby allowing you to draw more cards, place more cubes, or resist human counter-attacks. Discard contagion cards matching the color of the city you want to start to infect (two cards) or infect more (one card), using any two cards as a joker, if you wish. Place cubes equal to your current transmission rate. Each city card has a colored border (with all cities on the same continent having a matching border), a special action awarded to the player who places the final cube on the card, and three numbers; the large number shows the number of cubes needed to close the city and the number of points scored by whoever has the majority of cubes in this city when it closes, while the two smaller numbers show the points awarded to those with the second- and third-most cubes.

Events take place at the start, end or middle of your turn, as specified on the card, and they might benefit or harm you directly &mdash; say, by giving you a contagion card for each city you infect or forcing you to remove cubes from the board &mdash; or they might affect what&#39;s possible on a turn, such as making it more or less costly to infect a city. The WHO cards are generally bad for you, but your resistance allows you to lessen whatever the penalty would be based on its level. Need to remove three cubes from the board? If your resistance is at level 3, drop it down one level and you don&#39;t have to remove any. Some event cards feature a city icon, which brings a new city card into play, or a skull; when the second skull comes out, you have an intermediate scoring round in which whoever has the most cubes in a city scores points equal to the lowest value in that city. Once the event/WHO deck runs out or only two city cards remain in play, the game ends, with players conducting a final scoring round to see which virus is victorious.

Everything must be well organized: wheelbarrows must be filled with goods at the warehouses, then swiftly transported by the assistants to various destinations. Your goal? Be the first merchant to collect a certain number of rubies.&nbsp;In Istanbul, you lead a group of one merchant and four assistants through 16 locations in the bazaar. At each such location, you can carry out a specific action. The challenge, though, is that to take an action, you must move your merchant and an assistant there, then leave the assistant behind (to handle all the details while you focus on larger matters). If you want to use that assistant again later, your merchant must return to that location to pick him up. Thus, you must plan ahead carefully to avoid being left with no assistants and thus unable to do anything...&nbsp;In more detail, on a turn you move your merchant and his retinue of assistants one or two steps through the bazaar, either leave an assistant at that location or collect an assistant left earlier, then perform the action. If you meet other merchants or certain individuals at the location, you might be able to take a small extra action. Possible actions include:&nbsp; Paying to increase your wheelbarrow capacity, which starts the game with a capacity of only two for each good. Filling your wheelbarrow with a specified good to its limit. Acquiring a special ability, and the earlier you come, the easier they are to collect. Buying rubies or trading goods for rubies. Selling special combinations of goods to make the money you need to do everything else. When a merchant has collected five rubies in his wheelbarrow, players complete that round, then the game ends. If this player is the only one who&#39;s reached this goal, he wins immediately; otherwise ties are broken by money in hand.

Early encounters have only served to prove that the worlds militaries are hopelessly out-gunned. Panic leads to riots and governments struggle to maintain any control. Human civilization is on the brink of collapse. As the department heads of XCOM you and your friends must succeed where the worlds militaries have failed. You lead the elite members of an international, military organisation which is funded by a secret coalition. It is your job to destroy UFOs, research Alien technology uncover the alien invasion plan and find some way to turn back the alien invaders. You must do this all while preventing the collapse of the governments that secretly fund your organisation.&nbsp; Paris has fallen. New York is a pile of rubble spilling into the Atlantic. Alien attacks against Nanjing and Changzhou prompt widespread panic throughout the streets of Shanghai. Defense satellites detect UFOs in orbit over Mexico, Russia, and Brazil. Military responses have proven ineffectual. Fear and anxiety lead to widespread riots. Human civilization stands upon the brink of collapse&hellip;&nbsp;You are humanity&rsquo;s last hope.&nbsp;In XCOM: The Board Game, you and up to three friends assume the roles of the leaders of the elite, international organization known as XCOM. It is your job to defend humanity, quell the rising panic, and turn back the alien invasion.&nbsp;Where the world&rsquo;s militaries have failed to stand against the alien invaders, you must succeed. To do so, you must make strategic use of the resources available to you. You must launch Interceptors to shoot down alien UFOs, assign soldiers to key missions, research alien technology, and use that technology to defend your base, all while you try to keep the world from collapsing just long enough that you can coordinate one final mission to repel the invaders for good.&nbsp; Innovative Digital Enhancement&nbsp;The most notable aspect of XCOM: The Board Game is the way that it incorporates a free and innovative digital app into the core of its gameplay, then uses the app to promote a unique play experience unlike anything you and your friends have previously encountered in a board game. This digital companion will be available both as a downloadable app and as an online tool.&nbsp;The app&rsquo;s primary function is to coordinate the escalating alien invasion, randomly selecting from one of five different invasion plans. Each invasion plan represents a general outline that the alien commanders will use to coordinate the arrival of new UFOs, plan strikes against your base, and respond to your successes or failures as it seeks to conquer Earth. The app manages all of these tasks and heighten&rsquo;s the game&rsquo;s tension as it forces you to respond in real-time. Then, after you move quickly to coordinate your response, you engage the enemy in the untimed resolution phase and feed the results to the app. Based upon these results, the app launches the invasion&#39;s next strikes. Additionally, the app teaches you the rules, controls the information that your satellites provide you, and tracks the progress of your resistance efforts, even as it allows you to enjoy the game at any of three levels of difficulty: Easy, Normal, or Hard.&nbsp; A crisis card The use of this app does more than simply streamline your play experience and track your turns in real-time. It also permits a uniquely dynamic turn structure. While the variety of game phases remains the same from round to round, the order in which you and your friends must play through them may change, as may the number of a given phase.&nbsp;As a result, while you&rsquo;ll want to know where UFOs appear before you deploy your Interceptors, the alien invaders may be able to disrupt your satellite intel and force you to deploy your Interceptors on patrol with limited or no knowledge of the UFOs current whereabouts.

Some believe that he has always guarded the manor house, even before the death of the High Mage that lived there. Others suggest that he was unintentionally created from residual magic released by the wizard&#39;s death. Still others would say that the ravens created a new guardian after the passing of their old master. Whether Skarn is a raging monster hungry for power or a misunderstood soul devoted to a lonely cause, all agree that Skarn&#39;s potential stretches far beyond what can be allowed.&nbsp;Descent: Journeys in the Dark (Second Edition) &ndash; Skarn Lieutenant Pack includes a detailed, sculpted plastic figure of Skarn to replace the lieutenant token included in the Manor of Ravens expansion as well as a ten-card Plot deck that lets you spread Skarn&#39;s regenerative abilities to the monsters under your command.&nbsp;This Plot deck also gives you the opportunity to unleash Skarn on Terrinoth by summoning him into battle as your agent in any quest that does not include him as a lieutenant. In battle, heroes will find Skarn a powerful opponent, resilient to damage and able to mend his own wounds in the heat of combat. What&#39;s more, Skarn&#39;s attacks frequently damage more than one hero, possibly threatening an entire hero party at once if they move in too close.",https://t.cfjump.com/33917/p/33972644,http://www.ozgameshop.com/board-game-expansions/descent-journeys-into-the-dark-2nd-edition-skarn-lieutenant-pack?utm_source=commission+factory&amp;utm_medium=shopping&amp;utm_campaign=commission+factory+shopping+data+feed+(17/05/2017),http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33972644.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33972644@50x50.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33972644@100x100.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33972644@120x120.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33972644@200x200.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33972644@300x300.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33972644@400x400.jpg,21.99 AUD,FANTASY FLIGHT GAMES,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The game is accessible to casual as well as expert gamers, and has a mature theme. The rules of ILLEGAL are simple, but the game will challenge your skills in negotiation, misdirection, discretion, charisma, and persuasion. The more you play, the more you will learn to expand and master these skills. Each game lasts about half an hour, and is packed with intense exchanges, interactions and a lot of humour.&nbsp;Launch into this risqu&eacute; adventure! Dare to become one of these offbeat dealers and get a good laugh with your friends.&nbsp;How to Play&nbsp;ILLEGAL is played in two phases:&nbsp;During the first phase, each player receives a deck of cards prepared by the Game Master (GM). These decks assign each player his dealer role and gives him a good quantity of the corresponding resources. Each player&#39;s deck also specifies his buyer role, and he will make every effort during the game to get as many resources as possible of the type he is interested in. These roles are kept secret until the end of the game.&nbsp;Players leave the table and split up into continually changing pairs or groups to negotiate and exchange some of their resources, away from prying eyes. Every three minutes, they return to the table to collect new resources at the docks (from the GM). Then they go again for another three minutes of secret dealing.&nbsp;The second phase, called the Tribunal phase, starts once the players have returned to the table and the GM has run out of resources.&nbsp;At the tribunal, players play the roles of jury members, witnesses, suspects and judges! They openly discuss their suspicions concerning the secret roles assigned to every other player. The GM reveals the suspect cards in pairs representing the dealer and buyer roles assigned to the various players. For each card pair, players have one minute to debate. After one minute, a simultaneous vote is cast, and a suspect is formally accused.&nbsp;Scoring&nbsp;At the end of the game, each player reveals his role pair and acquired resources. He scores one victory point for each resource acquired corresponding to his buyer role, one point for each suspect card accusing him wrongly, thus rewarding him for his skills in misdirection and discretion, but he loses 5 points for each suspect card accurately accusing him, representing 5 years spent in prison. It is very easy to end the game with a 10-year jail sentence if you are insufficiently discreet or are too greedy!",https://t.cfjump.com/33917/p/33972645,http://www.ozgameshop.com/party-and-family-board-games/illegal-party-game?utm_source=commission+factory&amp;utm_medium=shopping&amp;utm_campaign=commission+factory+shopping+data+feed+(17/05/2017),http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33972645.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33972645@50x50.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33972645@100x100.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33972645@120x120.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33972645@200x200.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33972645@300x300.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33972645@400x400.jpg,24.99 AUD,ASMODEE,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The guests are divided into two factions, with both planning to &quot;dismiss&quot; the king. One faction plans to smuggle a dagger into the feast hall to &quot;open the king&#39;s heart to the realm&quot; at the right time, while the other faction hopes to give the king &quot;renewed motivation&quot; with a poisoned drink. In The Last Banquet, each player is a guest at the feast and needs to help his faction reach its goal and ensure that this will truly be the king&#39;s last banquet.

Each player secretly &quot;owns&quot; two of the twelve characters in the house, and each character starts in a different room of the house. On a turn, a player either moves any character that is alone in a room into an adjacent room or starts a fight in a room that contains at least two characters. Well, it&#39;s not much of a fight really, as the player removes one character from the room and places it in a line with other removed characters. Once a single character remains, the round ends.

As a part of this maiden voyage, the corporation has agreed to let you reinvest any wealth you uncover back into training your Pod pilots, increasing their skills and efficiencies. Will you be remembered as the greatest Solarus Corporation employee in the galaxy? Super Motherload is a tile-laying deck-building game, which means that you have your own deck of cards from which you draw each turn. The cards in your deck start out very basic, but over the course of the game you add new and more powerful cards to it. You use these cards to bomb and drill minerals and other bonuses from the game board. You then use the minerals you&#39;ve collected as money to purchase better cards for your deck. Some cards give you an immediate bonus when you purchase them, and some give you other bonuses when you use them to drill. Each card you purchase from your library is worth victory points (VPs). You can also gain VPs from achievement cards that become available throughout the game. Whoever has the most VPs at the end of the game wins.

When using the cards, two cards will become locked and will not be able to be used next turn. The entire game lasts two &quot;game years&quot;, and each year consists of four seasons (a.k.a. turns). At the start of each season, players see the heroes and events to come in the following season, allowing them to prepare. At the end of each season after the first, heroes are allocated to each player according to the players&#39; level of evilness. Heroes range from mighty heroes to sneaky thieves. Each hero has its own power for which the player needs to prepare for. At the end of each year, the heroes travel into the dungeons to fight. Scoring in the game is based upon what you have built, the monsters you have hired and the heroes you have captured. The Festival Season expansion adds a fifth season to the year: festival season. More time to build your dungeon, but also more time for adventurers to gather a larger party. There are new monsters, rooms, and traps to prepare your dungeon for the battle, but also new nasty spells for the adventurers and sneaky bards who encourage them to perform so-called &quot;heroic&quot; deeds &ndash; not to mention two paladins for each year, now ready to punish up to two evil players. Would you like to push other players toward evil instead of moving yourself toward good when visiting the city? What about making an investment instead of traditional gold digging? Or what about repairing conquered tunnels or rooms instead of digging new ones? Only eight actions are still available to you, but each season one of those actions is replaced by an alternate set of spaces that offer new and intriguing options. And did we mention that it has recently become fashionable for dungeon lords to have their own personal pets?",https://t.cfjump.com/33917/p/33972758,http://www.ozgameshop.com/rpg-and-fantasy-board-games/dungeon-lords-happy-anniversary?utm_source=commission+factory&amp;utm_medium=shopping&amp;utm_campaign=commission+factory+shopping+data+feed+(17/05/2017),http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33972758.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33972758@50x50.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33972758@100x100.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33972758@120x120.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33972758@200x200.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33972758@300x300.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33972758@400x400.jpg,152.99 AUD,Czech Games,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

You and the other players each have a team of five scientists, and you want to capture animal species so that you can study them &mdash; and, of course, score points.&nbsp;The game board in La Isla consists of a set of oddly-shaped tiles that are placed in a circular arrangement around a central polygonal tile. Thirty-five animal tokens (seven each of five types) are placed at random on spaces numbered 2, 3 and 4 on the game board; these numbers equal the number of camps that surround these spaces.&nbsp;On a turn, a player has three cards that he places face-down in the A, B and D spaces on his card display. All players reveal their A cards at the same time, then place them in one of the three slots at the top of their display; the image depicted on the top of this card shows the special power that the owner of this card has available. Once a player has filled all three slots on her display, future cards placed with the A action cover an existing card.&nbsp;After revealing the cards in their B slots simultaneously, the players collect the goods depicted in the lower-left corner of their individual card.&nbsp;Each player in turn then places one of his scientists on a camp, first paying two resources of the type matching that camp. (If all of a player&#39;s scientists are on the board, she moves one of these scientists.) If the player now has a scientist on each camp surrounding an animal space, she takes that animal tile, scoring points for it as noted on the board (4, 3 or 2 points).&nbsp;Finally, the card in the D slot increases the value of one animal. You (and only you!) immediately score one point per animal of the type you moved up on the scale. If you don&#39;t have an animal of that tpe you don&#39;t get any points. Each animal has a points threshold so that if you move an animal up, say, four times, each animal of this type is worth an extra point at the end of the game. The scale goes up to five so that every animal can be worth up five points at the end of the game. When the sum of these values for all five animals equals seven, nine or eleven (based on the number of players), the game ends at the conclusion of the round. Players then tally their final scores to see who wins.",https://t.cfjump.com/33917/p/33972789,http://www.ozgameshop.com/party-and-family-board-games/la-isla?utm_source=commission+factory&amp;utm_medium=shopping&amp;utm_campaign=commission+factory+shopping+data+feed+(17/05/2017),http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33972789.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33972789@50x50.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33972789@100x100.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33972789@120x120.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33972789@200x200.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33972789@300x300.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33972789@400x400.jpg,59.99 AUD,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This track offers an urban terrain which alternates between curves and straight lines.

Will you race your star cruiser boldly down the middle of the Imperial Fleet, firing at enemy ships on both sides? Will you dare your opponent to allow you the use of the Advanced Gunnery objective? Or will you circle the Imperial fleet at a distance, taking shots from battery armament enhanced by Admiral Ackbar, Slaved Turrets and the Defiance title?

Each of the five railroad companies has five to eight shares, and in addition to being a share of the company, each share card has a box on it that indicates another company. Players start with particular stock holdings based on the number of players in the game and their position in turn order. &nbsp; Each turn, one stock card is revealed from the deck. Players earn $1 for each share of this color that they own, then an auction ensues. Turn by turn, players must drop one of their bidding chips into a bowl in order to stay in the auction. When a player passes, whether by necessity or choice, they take all of the chips from the bowl, thereby earning bidding power for future auctions. &nbsp; When all but one player has passed, this last player wins the auction and has the right to either keep the share or sell stock matching the color of the company depicted on the bottom of the share; the player who dropped out of the auction last takes the action that the winner didn&#39;t take. If a player sells stock, they either sell all shares of this color that they own, earning as much for each share as the number of those stock cards face up on the table or they sell none of them; in the latter case, the player places a station depot in their color on an empty space of the appropriate color on the game board.

As tragedies happen, players loop back in time, restarting the scenario from the beginning and trying to deduce who the culprit was and why the tragedy occurred.&nbsp;The players win if they manage to maintain status quo &mdash; that is, if no tragedies occur to the key individuals &mdash; for a set number of days, within a set number of loops.

It allows players to simulate the diplomatic, economic, and political maneuverings that preceded the Second World War, either as a stand alone game or as an expansion for A World at War. (Unlike Days of Decision, Gathering Storm covers only the European events leading to war.) Gathering Storm, both a game in its own right and a prequel to GMT&rsquo;s A World at War, covers the period from 1935 to the outbreak of World War II, whenever that might be. Like A World at War, Gathering Storm simulates the military, economic, political, diplomatic, research and production preparations for the Second World War, allowing the players to explore what might have happened if: - Admiral Doenitz had convinced his superiors of the importance of submarine warfare in the impending war with Britain. - Germany had pursued the Z Plan earlier and more consistently. - The development of the &ldquo;Ural bomber&rdquo; had been pursued. - Poland had become a German satellite, rather than resisting German aggression. - War had broken out over the Sudetenland, or even the remilitarization of the Rhineland. - Mussolini had given a lower priority to naval armaments, to the benefit of the Italian armor and air forces. - France had extended the Maginot Line. - de Gaulle&rsquo;s arguments to expand and strengthen France&rsquo;s armor units had been accepted. - Britain had rearmed sooner. - Russia had deferred the Great Purges. Or accelerated them. - The Spanish civil war had been won by the Loyalists. - A civil war had broken out in Yugoslavia. Or Greece. - Atomic fission had been discovered earlier. - The Second World War had begun with a Franco-Italian conflict. Or a French pre-emptive attack on Germany. Or a Russo-German war, with Italy and the Western Allies neutral. - War comes early. Or later, in 1940 or even 1941. - YOU had been in command. Gathering Storm can be played as a separate game in a single session, with its own victory conditions, but A World at War players will want to press on and see how the war they have created plays out. While using different mechanics, Gathering Storm&#39;s structure is consistent with A World at War and allows for a seamless transition to whatever alternate war the players planned &ndash; or stumbled into. Some 30 years in development, with three years of design and playtesting, Gathering Storm, includes the following: - Six random events each turn, providing unlimited replay value. - Economics based on tiles and activity counters, eliminating any paperwork. - Flexible mobilization rules, allowing players to emphasis civilian or military production &ndash; each at the expense of the other. - Unit construction which allows players to activate reserve units for immediate benefits, at a cost of limiting future options. - Variable research, which can focus on air, naval, military or intelligence projects, as well as short or long term gains. - A fast-moving diplomatic system, with each player allocating diplomatic counters each turn. Diplomatic targets are public, but the points allocated to them are not. - Shipbuilding that allows varied fleets, including the possibility of 5-factor super battleships. - Ahistorical A World at War counters, including armor units of different strengths and additional ships. - A dynamic crisis system, in which the Allies can appease or oppose the Axis, with neither side necessarily being certain whether war might break out. - No dice. Gathering Storm is a must-buy for any committed A World at War player, an excellent &ndash; and possibly dangerously time consuming &ndash; introduction to the A World at War universe for those unfamiliar with that game, and a enjoyable and instructive fast-paced game all on its own.",https://t.cfjump.com/33917/p/33972913,http://www.ozgameshop.com/war-board-games/gathering-storm?utm_source=commission+factory&amp;utm_medium=shopping&amp;utm_campaign=commission+factory+shopping+data+feed+(17/05/2017),http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33972913.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33972913@50x50.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33972913@100x100.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33972913@120x120.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33972913@200x200.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33972913@300x300.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33972913@400x400.jpg,149.99 AUD,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The Punishing One was the signature vessel of the bounty hunter Dengar, a crass and battered Corellian. Despite his slovenly appearance, Dengar earned a reputation as one of the galaxy&#39;s most effective mercenaries, and he was one of the elite bounty hunters that Darth Vader recruited after the Battle of Hoth to look for the Millennium Falcon.&nbsp;Similarly, the Punishing One was also much more than the lightly-armed and crescent-shaped JumpMaster 5000 that it seemed to be. Outfitted with an improved engine bay and upgraded weapons systems, which included torpedo launchers and an astromech gunner, the Punshing One, like its owner, traded away its flair in favor of blunt force. The Punishing One Expansion Pack brings the JumpMaster 5000 to your table as a pre-painted, large-base, turret ship with an attack value of two, agility of two, five hull, and four shields.

As temporal agents, you and your team will be sent into the bodies of beings from different worlds or realities to successfully complete the missions given to you. Failure is impossible, as you will be able to go back in time as many times as required.&nbsp;T.I.M.E Stories is a narrative game, a game of &quot;decksploration&quot;. Each player is free to give their character as deep a &quot;role&quot; as they want, in order to live through a story, as much in the game as around the table. But it&#39;s also a board game with rules which allow for reflection and optimization.&nbsp;At the beginning of the game, the players are at their home base and receive their mission briefing. The object is then to complete it in as few attempts as possible. The actions and movements of the players will use Temporal Units (TU), the quantity of which depend on the scenario and the amount of players. Each attempt is called a &quot;run&quot;; one run equals the use of all of the Temporal Units at the players&#39; disposal. When the TU reach zero, the agents are recalled to the agency, and restart the scenario from the beginning, armed with their experience. The object of the game is to make the perfect run, while solving all of the puzzles and overcoming all of a scenario&rsquo;s obstacles.&nbsp;The base box contains the entirety of the T.I.M.E Stories system and allows players to play all of the scenarios, the first of which &mdash; Asylum &mdash; is included. During a scenario, which consists of a deck of 120+ cards, each player explores cards, presented most often in the form of a panorama. Access to some cards require the possession of the proper item or items, while others present surprises, enemies, riddles, clues, and other dangers.&nbsp;You usually take possession of local hosts to navigate in a given environment, but who knows what you&#39;ll have to do to succeed? Roam a med-fan city, looking for the dungeon where the Syaan king is hiding? Survive in the Antarctic while enormous creatures lurk beneath the surface of the ice? Solve a puzzle in an early 20th century asylum? That is all possible, and you might even have to jump from one host to another, or play against your fellow agents from time to time...&nbsp;In the box, an insert allows players to &quot;save&quot; the game at any point, to play over multiple sessions, just like in a video game. This way, it&#39;s possible to pause your ongoing game by preserving the state of the receptacles, the remaining TU, the discovered clues, etc.&nbsp;T.I.M.E Stories is a decksploring game in which each deck makes anything possible!&nbsp; Players 2-4 Playing time 60-90 minutes Suggested ages 10+",https://t.cfjump.com/33917/p/33972939,http://www.ozgameshop.com/strategy-board-games/t-i-m-e-stories?utm_source=commission+factory&amp;utm_medium=shopping&amp;utm_campaign=commission+factory+shopping+data+feed+(17/05/2017),http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33972939.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33972939@50x50.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33972939@100x100.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33972939@120x120.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33972939@200x200.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33972939@300x300.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33972939@400x400.jpg,65.99 AUD,Space Cowboys,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

After player has completed the task(s) he can either end the turn and thus get the points, or try to get more points by pulling out a new token and then completing the tasks. However, if the player chooses to continue, he must complete the task before he can end the turn and this is the risk - if the time runs out while he is still performing the task, the turn ends immediately and the player doesn&#39;t receive any points this turn (any cards the player completed during this turn are put in the discard pile).

New powers of interstellar travel make it possible for earthlings to find a new home. Competing teams of human explorers use space stations spread throughout the universe as bases for discovering new worlds and befriending aliens to help them in their quest. Explorer teams are not only racing each other, but meteors are striking planets and threatening these new worlds as well. Will your team be able to reach a planet in time to use its resources and protect it from future meteor strikes? Cosmic Run is a quick, push-your-luck, space race for 1-4 players. On a turn, a player rolls dice and must commit at least 1 of them to one of the various exploration tracks or to an alien card. Some of the tracks require multiple identical dice, with the most valuable tracks costing many identical dice. However, once a player commits a die, it cannot be moved.

Foremost of these great achievements in the city is the massive &quot;Porta Nigra&quot;, a large Roman city gate located in Trier, Germany that dates to the 2nd century.

Each player commands a master builder, who moves around a circular track on the game board, enabling you to buy or build only where this master builder is located. Moving the master builder to farther locations along the track is expensive, so players must plan their movements and builds carefully.

The old king has just died childless, and the new succession must be decided before the end of this year. You are a local baron or countess with as good a claim as anyone else, so now is the time to grab the throne. Your peers understand only force, and your subjects understand only gold. Gather your men, pay your knights, and assert your claim. Everyone will recognize the strongest and richest as the rightful monarch. In Melee you want to be the first person to capture an opposing castle (at which point the game ends immediately) or to have the most land and gold at the end of the year. Money is tight, and gold is used in the game both to build new units and to attack. The more gold you have and spend on your troops, the more motivated they will be and the higher your probability of success. Each player starts the game with a Castle, one unit of foot soldiers, and 15 gold coins. The game begins with a drafting session in which you purchase units (soldiers, knights, camps and catapults) and bid on special abilities that will enhance your income, attack, or other options in the game. The game is then played over four turns (seasons), and in each turn players simultaneously choose one of three potential actions: (a) tax, (b) build new units, or (c) move and attack. Each turn ends with players collecting income. To attack, you move your unit into an occupied area, then secretly decide how much gold you will spend to motivate your troops. The defender then has to guess how much you have spent. If the defender guesses wrong, the attack succeeds; if the defender is correct, the attack fails and you lose your unit. Regardless of success you have spent your gold, so the tight trade-off that players have to assess is whether to be cheap with your men so that you can conserve gold for future builds and attacks, or be generous to increase your chances now but limit future options. The different abilities available in each game make for varied strategies and strong replayability as no two games are alike. After the initial strategic planning stage, Melee is fast and highly interactive. Beware as the game can end suddenly with a bold attack on an inadequately defended castle, making for a game that can be very nasty, brutish and short.",https://t.cfjump.com/33917/p/33973013,http://www.ozgameshop.com/war-board-games/melee?utm_source=commission+factory&amp;utm_medium=shopping&amp;utm_campaign=commission+factory+shopping+data+feed+(17/05/2017),http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33973013.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33973013@50x50.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33973013@100x100.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33973013@120x120.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33973013@200x200.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33973013@300x300.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33973013@400x400.jpg,23.49 AUD,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The scientists programmed each of these Worlds with an individual set of laws and rules which the residents strictly follow and consider most important for their lives. These may be exploration, consumption, economics, military, etc., and each is unique. You can visit all of these 504 alternate Earths to experience how the people are living, and decide which of these worlds harbors the best civilization. On which World do you want to live? Explore them all and decide! 504 is a game that creates 504 different games out of one box. The game consists of nine modules: Module 1: Pick-Up &amp; Deliver Module 2: Race Module 3: Privileges Module 4: Military Module 5: Exploration Module 6: Roads Module 7: Majorities Module 8: Production Module 9: Shares In each single game, you take three different modules from the nine available and assemble them in any order you like to create a new game. (504 = 9 * 8 * 7 = the number of distinct permutations of three items from a set of nine. The order of the three game modules is significant, and modules cannot be repeated.) For example, you can play: a racing game that expands through exploration with technology improving the racing or exploration (World &quot;253&quot;). an 18XX-style stock game with network building for income and production sites to provide workers for the road building (World &quot;968&quot;). a war game with a pick-up and deliver economy and bonus scoring from majorities (&quot;World 417&quot;).

The Board Game,Toys &amp; Games &gt; Games &gt; Board Games,"M.U.L.E. was first published as a computer game in 1983. Inspired by board games, it became a breakthrough, then a classic. Now this warm-hearted game of cut-throat capitalism is finally available as a board game!&nbsp;In M.U.L.E. The Board Game, you are one of the pioneering and industrious species of a Galactic Federation. Together with your fellow colonists, you attempt to settle the distant Planet Irata with the so-called help of a mule-like machine you all learn to hate. But for now, he&#39;s all you&#39;ve got. Well, him and your fellow colonists. I wouldn&#39;t count on their help, though &mdash; not unless there&#39;s profit. Good luck. You&#39;ll need it.&nbsp;In M.U.L.E. (abbreviated from &ldquo;Multiple Use Labor Element&rdquo;), players claim plots of land and install mechanical robots (M.U.L.E.s) to work on them. M.U.L.E.s produce goods that colonists can use, sell for profit or stockpile for (hopefully) even more profit:&nbsp; Smithore is a metal that cannot be used by players directly, but can be sold to The Store. The Store uses Smithore to manufacture M.U.L.E.s. Since players need M.U.L.E.s to produce their Goods, they must sell Smithore to increase their production. Crystite is a luxury mineral with a highly volatile price. It is not needed for anything on Planet Irata, but can be exported to other worlds for great profits (unless stolen by Pirates &ndash; you have been warned!) Food is needed by players to take Development Actions, such as Assaying Lands or Installing/Refitting M.U.L.E.s. Energy is needed to power M.U.L.E.s. You&#39;ll know the value of Energy when you lack it. &nbsp;There will be unexpected surpluses and shortages of different goods, causing market prices to fluctuate. Players must plan ahead while maintaining flexibility to change their plans as all kinds &rdquo;fun&rdquo; planetary disasters hit them. Interaction between colonists is highly opportunistic: they will gladly help you if there&#39;s profit in it for them. Or maybe not. You&#39;ll get to see the true color of your friends by playing M.U.L.E. with them. The most cunning settler and trader receives fame, fortune, and the honorary title of First Founder! There is also an overall Colony Retirement score, describing how your colony succeeded (or failed) as a whole.

The game is divided into three ages, marked with different ship types. The first age is that of the galley, followed by the age of the galleon, then finally the steamship age. The board combines a track showing the development of ships, similar to that in Automobile, with a map of Europe and an area representing the rest of the world. Your turn is divided into two phases. In the first phase, you choose to either conduct commerce (such as selling goods, taxing locations or improving your warehouse) or take a card, selecting one from seven on display; the cards vary in their effects, granting money, victory points or special actions. In the second phase, you choose whether to place a ship, move a ship, or retrieve ships/merchants. When you place a ship, you do so in either the merchant box or the warship box in one of eleven levels. A merchant allows you to place a merchant cube on the board, giving you one or two goods counters to place in your warehouse. A warship lets you take control of a location at the cost of one food goods counter. Once all of your ships are on the board, you can either move them (paying money to advance its level and take the associated action) or retrieve it from the board so that you can place it elsewhere later. As ships are placed in a level, the cost of placing in the next level reduces &mdash; until finally somebody is willing to pay the cost to place in that level (which earns bonus points and possible additional income). When a ship is placed in the first galleon level, galleys become redundant; similarly, someone placing in the first steamship level makes galleons redundant. During the galleon and steamship ages, you can pay extra to move more ships, so having money in hand gives you a greater range of options and allows you to use your fleet more efficiently. When placing ships, you can initially place only in &quot;1&quot; locations, which are grouped around the eastern Mediterranean Sea. Once someone pays to move to a &quot;2&quot; location, which are grouped around the western Mediterranean, that area opens to others, with the other areas being Northern Europe (3), the Americas (4), East Indies (5) and the Pacific (6). As soon as a new area opens, players score points for merchants and control discs in the present area, with the points earned being the same as the number of the area. Ships includes six types of goods: food, oil, metal, wine, cloth and spices. Each has a monetary value as well as a special power. Food can be used to take control of locations, thus building an empire. Oil can be used to gain extra actions. Metal helps to advance your ships along the outer track. Wine can be converted to goods of a lower value. Cloth can be converted to victory points, while spices have the highest monetary value. You have to decide whether to cash your goods in for money or use their power.",https://t.cfjump.com/33917/p/33973036,http://www.ozgameshop.com/strategy-board-games/ships?utm_source=commission+factory&amp;utm_medium=shopping&amp;utm_campaign=commission+factory+shopping+data+feed+(17/05/2017),http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33973036.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33973036@50x50.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33973036@100x100.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33973036@120x120.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33973036@200x200.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33973036@300x300.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33973036@400x400.jpg,71.49 AUD,Treefrog Games,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In more detail, players take their first two turns to place their korrigans on the game board; with each korrigan you place, you look at the tokens in that location and keep one of them. These tokens show either gold (which possibly gives you points at the end of the game) or an animal (which allows you to pass through gates that bear that animal to reach a different landscape). From the third turn on, players use their animal tokens to move their korrigans and pick up more tokens. Each round the player holding the bag draws a rainbow token and places it in one of the rows or columns on the board; this means that the pot of gold won&#39;t appear in this row or column in the final part of the game. Once the gold is finally placed on the game board, players have a final round in which they try to reach the pot with their korrigans.

Join them in their exploration of the universe and their quest for victory. Players will explore, challenge each others, and engage in short-term or long-term alliances, but there will be battles and mighty spaceships involved. In Metal Adventures, you&#39;ll use cards to explore, enhance your ship and your crew, and live up to bold challenges. There will be negotiations, battle tactics, and the uncertainty and risk that really make a pirate&#39;s life. During the game, each player uses a fancy four-wheeled astrolabe to track their power (which can be improved via equipment), damage (which reduces power), glory (which is how players win), and the &quot;judgement of pirates&quot; (which affects glory). On a turn, a player either rests (gaining money and repairing their ship) or else travels (paying to do so), battles (either starships, planets or opponents), and optionally takes the &quot;tour of pirates&quot;, visiting one of the ten planets in the game and taken the action available there. Each player holds two trophy cards, and when they meet the conditions on one of them, they can reveal it to earn credits, glory or both. They can gain support (single-use cards) and equipment (providing power adjustments and possibly other special abilities), keeping at most four of these improvement cards at a time. Players can negotiate alliances and trade anything but glory, and while they must keep their word for immediate exchanges and actions, they can break promises or alliances in later turns, although doing so requires them to suffer the &quot;judgement of pirates&quot;, thereby affecting their glory count. Collect four such points, and they can no longer ally with other players or give or receive assistance.

These cards are full of quotes both from history and from famous Napoleonic movies: &ldquo;By God, sir, I have lost my leg. &ndash; By God, sir, so you have.&rdquo; or &ldquo;We shall match them with our lancers!&rdquo; Nobody can resist reading these with the right accent&hellip; The challenge You win the game by destroying half the total combat strength of the enemy army.

Instead of AI units being individually programmed as in past games, AI units utilize a unique emergent behavior and agent-based logic. Each situation is evaluated and the AI implements the best course of action using available resources and unit assets. Even veteran CoH players will be challenged to hone and adapt their playing styles in order to overcome the AI! In the Conflict of Heroes Solo System, players no longer track APs, but must make a Unit Spent Check after every action. The higher the cost in APs an action was, the higher the probability that the unit will be spent. Now a player must decide if he will augment his action with APs or increase his chance of keeping the unit fresh! Each Firefight has its own Mission Track. A Mission Track is a series of events that are triggered if the Mission Marker lands on an event&#39;s space. Certain orders advance the Mission Marker 1, 2 or 3 spaces, so the game is different each time you play. The firefight ends immediately when the Mission Marker lands on or passes the last space of the Mission Track.

In the game, foragers pick fruit from trees, fish in lakes, and hunt aurochs in the fields. After collecting these foods, the foragers return to a fire pit, where they &quot;share&quot; their food with the tribe and earn victory points. In addition, the foragers sometimes happen upon tools, which allow them to forage, fish, or hunt more efficiently. Of course, foragers are not completely altruistic and so they occasionally fight with each other to earn respect. The player who can best optimize their food and tool gathering, while also avoiding or winning skirmishes is the one who eventually earns the tribe leader title. The game is played over a predetermined number of rounds, depending upon the number of players. In each round, all players simultaneously choose an action card, from a hand of 3 action cards (drawn from a deck of 10) to use for that round. Each action card lists 5 different actions, but a player may only use 4 of those actions each round. Then, in clockwise order, each player performs 1 of the actions on their card until all players have performed 4 actions. Such actions include things like: walking, foraging, eating, discovering, resting, sharing, and picking up a tool. When players pick up food, they place it on their tableau, which tracks the food&#39;s freshness. At the end of each round, a &quot;spoilage card&quot; is flipped and all players &quot;age&quot; their food (i.e., move them along a food track). As the food gets older, it does not provide as much energy if eaten. Also, to score victory points, players must &quot;share&quot; their food before it spoils. In this sense, the players are racing not only against each other, but against nature.",https://t.cfjump.com/33917/p/33973096,http://www.ozgameshop.com/strategy-board-games/foragers?utm_source=commission+factory&amp;utm_medium=shopping&amp;utm_campaign=commission+factory+shopping+data+feed+(17/05/2017),http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33973096.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33973096@50x50.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33973096@100x100.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33973096@120x120.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33973096@200x200.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33973096@300x300.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33973096@400x400.jpg,35.99 AUD,Dr. Finn,,,,,,,,,,,,,32.39 AUD,,,,,,,,

With multiple hissing heads, spiked Dark Stone shards protruding from its body, and a brutal Dark Stone rattle, these savage beasts are a terror beyond imagining, made all the more frightening by their common appearance throughout the region.The Dark Stone Hydra is a gigantic and terrifying beast! It is not only massive, but also fast and deadly as it strikes, slithering between models to change targets and snapping with all of its fanged heads! The Dark Stone Radiation that taints this creature also exudes from its body, corrupting those that stray too close, and its ability to regenerate damage offsets the fact that it loses power as you cut off its heads.

Taking on the roles of Naruto, Sakura, Kakashi, Rock Lee, Sai and Shikamaru from the Hidden Leaf Village, players attempt to stop the Akatsuki from extracting the tailed beasts from their bearers and using them to power their ultimate weapon: The Ged&ocirc; Maz&ocirc;. &nbsp; In more detail, the Akatsuki start at one of the nine villages on the game board, spend at most three turns in that village, then (if they&#39;re not defeated there) move to the next village. Each Akatsuki character has its own strengths and weaknesses. The villages are distant from one another, so players can&#39;t race from one village to another after them, but must divide their forces to prepare for conflict, encountering unexpected events along the way. &nbsp; Each player has a character card showing Combat Ability, Chakra Reserve, and Strategy Value, as well as an experience track that allows them to power up over time. Each character also has a deck of fourteen ability cards, some common to each deck but most unique to that character. &nbsp; Each turn a character takes two actions from move, meditate, or fight. When you fight, you roll dice, hoping for shuriken. You can play cards to increase the number of dice you roll, but you must spend Chakra to play them and both cards and Chakra are limited. The enemy fights back if you don&#39;t deal enough damage to it, possibly triggering special powers and additional effects in the process. &nbsp; Once the Akatsuki arrive at Hidden Leaf Village, players must face Tobi and the Ged&ocirc; Maz&ocirc;, with their power being greater for each tailed beast that they stole on their way to this final showdown. &nbsp; Naruto Shippuden: The Board Game features three levels of play and a large variety of enemies, making each game a unique experience. &nbsp; Ages 13 Playing time 60 minutes Players 2-5",https://t.cfjump.com/33917/p/33973252,http://www.ozgameshop.com/strategy-board-games/naruto-shippuden-the-board-game?utm_source=commission+factory&amp;utm_medium=shopping&amp;utm_campaign=commission+factory+shopping+data+feed+(17/05/2017),http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33973252.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33973252@50x50.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33973252@100x100.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33973252@120x120.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33973252@200x200.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33973252@300x300.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33973252@400x400.jpg,78.49 AUD,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

When any player has six or fewer tokens in their supply, each player takes two more turns, then the game ends. At that point, if they&#39;ve created a continuous path between the two cities on a ticket, then they score the points on that ticket; if not, then they lose points instead.&nbsp;Ticket to Ride: Rails &amp; Sails puts a few twists on the TtR formula, starting with split card decks of trains and ships (with all of the wild cards going in the train deck). Three cards of each type are revealed at the start of the game, and when you draw cards, you replace them with a card from whichever deck you like. (Shuffle the card types separately to form new decks when needed.)&nbsp;Similarly, players choose their own mix of train and ship tokens at the start of the game. To claim a train route (rectangular spaces), you must play train cards (or wilds) and cover those spaces with train tokens, and to claim a ship route (oval spaces), you must play ship cards (or wilds) and cover those spaces with ship tokens. Ship cards depict one or two ships on them, and when you play a double-ship card, you can cover one or two ship spaces. You can take an action during play to swap train tokens for ships (or vice versa), and you lose one point for each token you swap.&nbsp;Some tickets show tour routes with multiple cities instead of simply two cities. If you build a network that matches the tour exactly, you score more points than if you simply include all of those cities in your network.&nbsp;Each player also starts the game with three harbors. If you have built a route to a port city, you can take an action during the game to place a harbor in that city (with a limit of one harbor per port). To place the harbor, you must discard two train cards and two ship cards of the same color, all of which must bear the harbor symbol (an anchor). At the end of the game, you lose four points for each harbor not placed, and you gain 10-40 points for each placed harbor depending on how many of your completed tickets show that port city.&nbsp;Ticket to Ride: Rails &amp; Sails includes a double-sided game board, with one side showing the world and the other side showing the Great Lakes of North America. Players start with a differing number of cards and tokens depending on which side they play, and each side has a few differences in gameplay.&nbsp; Ages 10+ Playing time 60-120 minutes Players 2-5",https://t.cfjump.com/33917/p/33973281,http://www.ozgameshop.com/party-and-family-board-games/ticket-to-ride-rails-and-sails?utm_source=commission+factory&amp;utm_medium=shopping&amp;utm_campaign=commission+factory+shopping+data+feed+(17/05/2017),http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33973281.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33973281@50x50.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33973281@100x100.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33973281@120x120.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33973281@200x200.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33973281@300x300.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33973281@400x400.jpg,99.99 AUD,Days Of Wonder,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Coins are scored for gem tiles on the mines you have claimed, with bonuses for dynamite tiles &mdash; but if there is too much dynamite, the mine (and all the riches within) are destroyed!&nbsp;In more detail, players sit around a circle composed of cave game boards and the guildhall game board, with sixty mining tiles placed face-down within this circle. Each round, while playing at the same time, players use one hand to look at one mining tile at a time, then place it on one of the cave game boards. At any time, a player can claim the guildhall or a cave by placing one of their three goblins on the board, after which no more tiles or goblins may be placed on this board.&nbsp;Once everyone has placed all of their goblins (or decided not to place them), players resolve the boards. The goblin on the guildhall draws a minion card that provides a special ability, while each goblin in a cave scores coins based on the gems, diamonds, dynamite and monsters found there; these goblins can also take minion cards if minion tiles have been placed in the cave.

The ashes from the first great war still darken the snow. The capitalistic city-state known simply as &ldquo;The Factory&rdquo;, which fueled the war with heavily armored mechs, has closed its doors, drawing the attention of several nearby countries.&nbsp;Scythe is a 4X board game set in an alternate-history 1920s period. It is a time of farming and war, broken hearts and rusted gears, innovation and valor. In Scythe, each player represents a character from one of five factions of Eastern Europa who are attempting to earn their fortune and claim their faction&#39;s stake in the land around the mysterious Factory. Players conquer territory, enlist new recruits, reap resources, gain villagers, build structures, and activate monstrous mechs.&nbsp;Each player begins the game with different resources (power, coins, combat acumen, and popularity), a different starting location, and a hidden goal. Starting positions are specially calibrated to contribute to each faction&rsquo;s uniqueness and the asymmetrical nature of the game (each faction always starts in the same place).&nbsp;Scythe gives players almost complete control over their fate. Other than each player&rsquo;s individual hidden objective card, the only elements of luck or variability are &ldquo;encounter&rdquo; cards that players will draw as they interact with the citizens of newly explored lands. Each encounter card provides the player with several options, allowing them to mitigate the luck of the draw through their selection. Combat is also driven by choices, not luck or randomness.&nbsp;Scythe uses a streamlined action-selection mechanism (no rounds or phases) to keep gameplay moving at a brisk pace and reduce downtime between turns. While there is plenty of direct conflict for players who seek it, there is no player elimination.&nbsp;Every part of Scythe has an aspect of engine-building to it. Players can upgrade actions to become more efficient, build structures that improve their position on the map, enlist new recruits to enhance character abilities, activate mechs to deter opponents from invading, and expand their borders to reap greater types and quantities of resources. These engine-building aspects create a sense of momentum and progress throughout the game. The order in which players improve their engine adds to the unique feel of each game, even when playing one faction multiple times.",https://t.cfjump.com/33917/p/33973304,http://www.ozgameshop.com/war-board-games/scythe?utm_source=commission+factory&amp;utm_medium=shopping&amp;utm_campaign=commission+factory+shopping+data+feed+(17/05/2017),http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33973304.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33973304@50x50.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33973304@100x100.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33973304@120x120.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33973304@200x200.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33973304@300x300.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33973304@400x400.jpg,116.99 AUD,Stonemaier Games,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Negotiate, bluff, forge alliances, threaten your rivals &mdash; use every tool at your disposal to spread your influence, establish supremacy, and claim the ultimate prize: the Iron Throne!&nbsp;In more detail, each turn centers around the resolution of an encounter between two players. These encounters can result in hostilities, startling conquests, and the spread of influence, or they can result in the formation of temporary alliances. And though only two players in any encounter will be the &quot;active&quot; players, your friends might offer you their support &mdash; or turn around and offer it to someone else.&nbsp;The encounters of The Iron Throne resolve quickly, but they are full of opportunities for cunning strategy, devious intrigues, and brokered alliances. Each features a challenger and a defender, and after these players assign characters to resolve the encounter on the behalf of their Houses, other players may offer their support to either side. In this way, an encounter that starts as a contest between the Lannisters and the Starks may escalate and draw in the support of the Tyrells or other Houses.&nbsp;However, there&#39;s more to the encounters of The Iron Throne than this initial jostling for power, even with all the alliances and betrayals it can entail. There are still schemes within schemes, and the bluffs, negotiations, and hidden information that color these encounters as the active players discuss the House cards they intend to play. Of course, there&#39;s a very good chance that one or both of them may be lying, but they can offer and even agree to a truce. Or they can bid cards from their hands, hoping to win hostilities with the higher total power.&nbsp;In the event of a truce, the active players discuss what they may give each other in order to maintain the peace. In the event of hostilities, however, one side will win, and the other will suffer. You might seize influence or take hostages, or you may even have your characters put to the sword.&nbsp;Win enough of these encounters, though &mdash; and find the right ones to lose &mdash; and you might find yourself in position to seize the Iron Throne. The goal of the game is to spread five of your influence to your opponents&#39; House cards and take the crown for yourself.",https://t.cfjump.com/33917/p/33973354,http://www.ozgameshop.com/strategy-board-games/game-of-thrones-hbo-the-iron-throne?utm_source=commission+factory&amp;utm_medium=shopping&amp;utm_campaign=commission+factory+shopping+data+feed+(17/05/2017),http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33973354.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33973354@50x50.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33973354@100x100.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33973354@120x120.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33973354@200x200.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33973354@300x300.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33973354@400x400.jpg,71.09 AUD,FANTASY FLIGHT GAMES,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

On a turn, you get to take only two actions, one for you and one for the spouse, from all the possibilities you&#39;ll find on a farm: collecting resources; building meadows; and so on. You might think about having kids in order to get more work accomplished, but first you need to expand your house. And what are you going to feed all the little rugrats?&nbsp; Agricola is a turn-based game. There are 14 game rounds occurring in 6 stages, with a Harvest at the end of each stage (after Rounds 4, 7, 9, 11, 13, and 14). Each player starts with two meeples that can each take an action per round. There are multiple options, and while the game progresses, you&#39;ll have more: each round a (fixed) additional option becomes available. Each action can be taken by only one player each round, so it&#39;s important to do some things with high preference. &nbsp; In comparison with the family game of the predecessor, much has changed: the new action each round is fixed, and the game has been simplified by removing stone and vegetables. Similar to Agricola: Die Bauern und das liebe Vieh, there are now buildings (replacing the major improvements) that score points for leftover resources at the end of the game.&nbsp; Also, there are no building restrictions (nor player boards).

In the center of the once great citadel stands a stone temple. Local legends tell of great treasures that lie buried beneath the temple, but despite many weeks of searching no doorway has been found. &nbsp; On the top of the temple stands a square stone altar. A small totem stands in the center of this, surrounded by a pattern of sixteen carved tiles. Examining them closely you discover an intricate series of mechanisms which allow the tiles to switch places and turn over, which reveals that each tile has a stone side and a gold side. Carvings on each side of the pillar indicate that a sequence of four key patterns must be made with the tiles to open the temple. Can you be the first to unlock the secrets of Codinca?&nbsp; In Codinca, each player has control of a set of four matching symbol tiles: Air, Water, Earth or Fire. Players take turns attempting to move their tiles into a series of four specific key patterns indicated on the key discs drawn at the beginning of the game; those patterns are a block of four, a line of four, four corners (can be four corners of any nine tiles as well as outside corners) and a diagonal line of four.&nbsp; On each turn a player must either switch and flip one of their own tiles with any adjacent tile, or switch one of their tiles with any adjacent tile and switch the same or another of their tiles with any adjacent tiles or flip two tiles, one of which must be one of their own tiles. In addition, players are allocated three Spirit Card that gives them the bonus move choice of Line Push or Rotate Four. This allows players to disguise their planned moves. On the back of the Spirt Card is a Trap Pattern. This can be used to change a set display of tiles from gold to stone and visa versa to match the pattern on the Trap Pattern. Players can match their required patterns in any order, and the first player to match all patterns wins. &nbsp; Players 2-4 Playing time 30 minutes Ages 8",https://t.cfjump.com/33917/p/33973365,http://www.ozgameshop.com/party-and-family-board-games/codinca?utm_source=commission+factory&amp;utm_medium=shopping&amp;utm_campaign=commission+factory+shopping+data+feed+(17/05/2017),http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33973365.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33973365@50x50.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33973365@100x100.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33973365@120x120.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33973365@200x200.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33973365@300x300.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33973365@400x400.jpg,25.99 AUD,Black Spindle,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Luckily (or perhaps unluckily), Big Potato have devised a new game to draw it out into the open. It&rsquo;s called Scrawl and it&rsquo;s about doodling your way to disaster.&nbsp;Each player is given a clipboard, a stack of whiteboard paper and a very questionable Scenario Card (&ldquo;Octopus Mating Season&rdquo;, for example). Each player would then have to do their best at illustrating their scenario before passing it to the player on their left. This player, having no idea what the original Scenario was, clips another page over it and attempts to describe the picture underneath. The clipboards are then passed along once more, with the next player attempting to illustrate the new description in front of them. This continues until each of the clipboards have returned to their original owners.&nbsp;Once the contents of the clipboards are displayed for all to see, players vote for their favourites in a run (most grins wins). Trust us, you&rsquo;ll be amazed at how &ldquo;Octopus Mating Season&rdquo; turned into &ldquo;Cat Orgy&rdquo; so easily. Contains 240 different Scenarios. Suitable for ages 17+ For best results, play with 4-8 people. Each game lasts 30 minutes. 27.6 x 7.9 x 22.9 cm Bad drawers make great Scrawlers",https://t.cfjump.com/33917/p/33973381,http://www.ozgameshop.com/party-and-family-board-games/scrawl-doodle-your-way-to-disaster?utm_source=commission+factory&amp;utm_medium=shopping&amp;utm_campaign=commission+factory+shopping+data+feed+(17/05/2017),http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33973381.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33973381@50x50.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33973381@100x100.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33973381@120x120.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33973381@200x200.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33973381@300x300.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33973381@400x400.jpg,42.99 AUD,Big Potato,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Gather resources to add buildings with new actions and launch ships to go whaling. Go out longest for the best choice, but wait too long and the whales become harder to catch. And don&#39;t forget to pay your crew when ships return! Carefully balance time management and timing to earn the most points in this medium-weight worker placement and resource management game. &nbsp; In more detail, over twelve rounds players take turns placing two workers per round, one at a time. The town board and whaling board contain basic game actions: taking goods (food, wood, brick), selling goods, building buildings, docking ships, and launching ships. These actions can be used multiple times per round, with the first player to do so in a round receiving a bonus or more goods or reducing the number of goods paid. &nbsp; Most buildings add extra action spaces with new actions, combined actions, and more powerful versions of basic actions. You own whatever you build, with others needing to pay to use them and you earning points from them at game&#39;s end. &nbsp; You need to pay to send ships whaling, choosing how far out to send them. At the end of the round, ships move closer to shore and whale tokens are drawn randomly. Ships that are farthest out have first chance to pick the valuable sperm whales, but as they move in, others have the opportunity to launch farther out and get a better pick, possibly leaving you with only empty seas. Over the course of the game, whales become more rare and empty seas more common. Once a ship reaches shore, a percentage of the profits (the &quot;lay&quot;) must be paid in order to keep the whales selected. &nbsp; After twelve rounds, all ships must return, and players total their points from buildings, whales, and extra money.

Eclairs!&quot; The glorious revolution has done away with tyranny! Now you and your friends make up the Revolutionary Committee, overseeing justice throughout the land. Still, now that the queen&#39;s gone, it would be a shame to let all that cake go to waste... &nbsp; Become the first among equals by amassing honour! Become happy by amassing cake! Send your friends&#39; pawns to the guillotine! First to forty cakes wins!&nbsp; Let Them Eat Cake is a game of committees, coercion, and cake. Elect your friends to positions of power in the hope that they look on your patronage favorably &mdash; or denounce them as enemies of the revolution. Alliances and betrayal are all fair game as you try to amass as much cake as you can before the revolution collapses. &nbsp; Each player starts the game with a set of voting cards, three pawns, three medals of honour, and some cake. Each round consists of a series of elections, from the Head of Committee to the Food Inspector. Each vote, after negotiating, bribing, and pleading, is simply a matter of each player secretly choosing a voting card of the player they wish to vote for. Each player&rsquo;s votes are multiplied by the number of pawns they have, and whoever is the Head of Committee will break any ties. Importantly, once you&rsquo;ve used a voting card, you cannot reuse it until you&rsquo;ve played all your cards, demanding shifting allegiances throughout the game. &nbsp; The first vote of the round determines the Head of Committee, the official tie-breaker. Soon thereafter players determine the Enemy of the Revolution, who must place one of their pawns on the guillotine, immediately and potentially permanently reducing their voting power. Next, players elect a Guillotine Operator, who decides whether or not the pawn on the guillotine is executed or spared. Once settled, a Secretary is elected to divvy out cake and generals to the players, one card per player. But before these cards are taken, the players elect a Food Inspector who may, at the cost of a medal, declare all cake unsafe. &nbsp; Throughout the game, players will accumulate medals, generals, and cake. Fewest medals make you the Enemy of the Revolution, but the player with the most Generals is immune to such accusations! Any player can spend their Generals to force a re-election or simply choose the winner of a vote. The game ends when one player reaches 40 or more cakes, a player has their last pawn executed, or the deck runs out. The player with the most cake wins!

You choose the dice you wish to use to pass the challenge, then play cards from your hand and use abilities from your character to blast, jump or run through the challenge. Your opponents can play cards from the Dr. Wily side of their hand to make your challenge more difficult, possibly doing damage or taking lives from you along the way. If you beat the challenge, you move forward on the stage a number of spaces determined by the challenge you defeated. &nbsp; Once all spaces are clear and you are face-to-face with the Robot Master, you enter the &quot;Boss Battle&quot;. You and your opponents now take turns battling each other until only one robot remains standing. If you are the victor, you take the Robot Master&#39;s powers from the character card, stacking it under your own character card.

Driven by the ambition of their king, the Greeks have arrived on the shores of Troy. Some seek power, some seek revenge, while still others seek the great moment in battle that will define their place in history. &nbsp; Agamemnon is a fast-paced strategy board game in which two players take on the roles of ancient Greek gods during the Trojan War. By tactically deploying warriors to where they&#39;re needed across the board, each player may influence the final outcome of the battles famously detailed in Homer&#39;s Iliad. Some areas will be decided by the strength of the warriors, others by sheer weight of numbers, and some by the inspiration your heroes provide. &nbsp; To begin the game, Strings of Fate tiles are placed on their matching spaces on the board, and each player receives one set of fifteen playing tiles. These tiles come in three varieties: Warriors, with a numerical value marking their strength, Leaders, with both a letter rank and a strength value, and Weavers who have no strength or rank, but instead manipulate the Strings of Fate. Each player will shuffle their tiles face down in front of them. &nbsp; The first player flips over one of their tiles, and places it on any available space. If it&rsquo;s a Weaver, its effect immediately comes into play: the Warp Weaver may swap two adjacent Strings of Fate, whilst the Weft Weaver simply splits all strings it&rsquo;s connected to. After the first turn, each player flips and plays two tiles on their turns. &nbsp; Once all the tiles have been placed, each string is resolved: each Strength String is won by the player with the highest combined strength contained within it; each Leadership String is won by the player with the single highest ranked tile within the string; and Force Strings are won by the player with the most tiles, including Weavers, in the string. Players claim all the tiles from Strings of Fate they have won, and the player with the most tiles at the end wins. &nbsp; Players 2 Playing time 20-30 minutes Ages 12",https://t.cfjump.com/33917/p/33973466,http://www.ozgameshop.com/strategy-board-games/agamemnon-board-game?utm_source=commission+factory&amp;utm_medium=shopping&amp;utm_campaign=commission+factory+shopping+data+feed+(17/05/2017),http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33973466.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33973466@50x50.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33973466@100x100.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33973466@120x120.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33973466@200x200.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33973466@300x300.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33973466@400x400.jpg,29.99 AUD,Osprey Games,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A new category of Heroes and Constructs are also introduced, and these powerful dual-cost cards require players to spend both types of game resources to purchase them. &nbsp; Players 1-4",https://t.cfjump.com/33917/p/33973485,http://www.ozgameshop.com/rpg-and-fantasy-board-games/ascension-x-war-of-shadows?utm_source=commission+factory&amp;utm_medium=shopping&amp;utm_campaign=commission+factory+shopping+data+feed+(17/05/2017),http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33973485.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33973485@50x50.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33973485@100x100.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33973485@120x120.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33973485@200x200.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33973485@300x300.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33973485@400x400.jpg,65.99 AUD,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Don&rsquo;t forget to bring some antidote when playing Raise Your Goblets!&nbsp;In Raise Your Goblets, players take the roles of nobles at a banquet, each one with their own agenda of personal vendetta. Each player has wine, poison and antidote tokens they can pour into the goblets, trying to poison their enemies while staying alive themselves! Each noble also has a special ability that allows them to bend or even break a rule.&nbsp;In more detail, each character has a plastic goblet, and each goblet is primed in secret at the start of the round with either wine, poison or antidote. On a turn, you take two actions, with actions being to peek inside your goblet, rotate all goblets left or right, swap your goblet with someone else&#39;s, or secretly add one of your wine, poison or antidote tokens to any goblet. Once someone has &quot;served&quot; all of their wine, they can call a toast on their turn instead of doing anything else. Each player, including the toaster, takes one more action, then everyone drinks. If you have more poison than antidote, you die.&nbsp;What&#39;s your goal in doing all of this? Well, at the start of a round you are given a target to kill, and everyone knows who is targeting whom. If at the end of a round, your target is dead, you score 1 point; if you&#39;re alive, you score 1 point; if both of these things are true, you score a bonus point (3 total). Also, whoever has the most wine in their cup scores 1 point.

Rumors, bribes, spies and poison are the tools of your trade. Council of Blackthorn is about secretly gaining power while convincing your rival council members that you are not a threat. Deflect all eyes onto your most powerful enemy and take the keys to the kingdom as well as a great seat at his or her execution. Attract too much attention to yourself and the King&rsquo;s axe will find you!&nbsp; Gain influence, accuse your rivals, keep your head!&nbsp; Game Overview and Objective&nbsp; Council of Blackthorn is a board game for 2 to 6 players. Each player assumes the role of a member of the Council of Blackthorn. There are several different council member characters to play. Each player must build influence with the kingdom&rsquo;s political factions by playing ally and building cards. Custom dice change the game conditions for each round. As players gain influence and power, they also gain hidden treason points. The players that appear to have the most power will typically gain more treason points. The player with the most treason points at the end of the game is beheaded for treason and is removed from the game. The remaining player with the most total influence points, wins the game. &nbsp; Players 2-6 Playing time 45-90 Ages 13",https://t.cfjump.com/33917/p/33973521,http://www.ozgameshop.com/strategy-board-games/council-of-blackthorn?utm_source=commission+factory&amp;utm_medium=shopping&amp;utm_campaign=commission+factory+shopping+data+feed+(17/05/2017),http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33973521.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33973521@50x50.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33973521@100x100.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33973521@120x120.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33973521@200x200.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33973521@300x300.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33973521@400x400.jpg,88.49 AUD,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Howard, is a scenario-based semi-cooperative asymmetric miniatures board game. One player is the Opponent, playing the Opposition forces, and the other players (1 to 4) play Conan and his companions: Shevatas the thief, Hadrathus the Priest/Sorcerer, Belit the pirate queen, Valeria the warrior, etc. The game is based purely on Robert E. Howard&#39;s novels and short stories (and not the movies or other non-Howardian material). The publisher has hired Patrice Louinet, a Howard expert, to make sure the art and the scenarios are compatible with Howard&#39;s vision.&nbsp;Each game is a scenario, played on a map. There will be several maps &mdash; Pictish Village, Underground temple, Tavern, Pirate ship, etc. &mdash; and each map can have several scenarios set on it. The game is fast, one hour approximately. It&#39;s possible to play several scenarios in a campaign, but you can also play each scenario individually. There will be a dozen playable scenarios in the base box.&nbsp;At the beginning of a scenario, players choose their team (Conan and two or three other heroes). The Opponent gathers all the miniatures (picts, Necromancer, skeleton warriors, monsters, etc.), tokens, cards from the chosen scenario. The game usually plays in a limited number of turns (ten, for instance). Each scenario can have very different objectives: find the princess captured by picts and hidden in a hut and leave the camp before the pict hunters return; find the magical key to open a sealed door, steal the jewel and leave; kill the Necromancer by the end of turn 10; survive by the end of turn 10; escape the prison; etc.&nbsp;During their turn, the heroes can activate or rest. If they activate, they can spend &quot;gems&quot; from their energy pool to do all sorts of actions: move, fight (melee or distance), defend, pick a lock, reroll, etc. If they rest, they can move a lot of gems from their &quot;spent&quot; pool box to their &quot;available&quot; pool box. When they take an action, they throw a number of dice equal to the number of gems they put in their action. There are three different kinds of dice: yellow (the weaker dice), orange (medium) and red (strong). Each character has a color based on their specialty: Conan throws red dice in combat while the Sorcerer throws yellow dice in combat; the thief throws red dice in Manipulation actions, while Conan throws orange dice; etc. Each player can have equipment cards (armor, magic potions, weapons, etc.) which give them bonuses on their dice rolls.&nbsp;The Opponent plays differently. He uses a board with eight slidable tiles, plus his own Energy gems. Each tile corresponds to one unit (1 to 3 miniatures) on the game mat, and all of the miniature abilities are written on this tile (movement, armor, attack, special abilities). The tile position on the board corresponds to the numbers 1-8. The Opponent has a pool of energy gems and each time he activates one unit, he needs to spend a number of gems matching the tile placement: tile#1 costs 1 energy gem, tile#2 costs 2 gems, etc. Whatever tile the Opponent chooses to activate, he spends the corresponding energy cost (moving his energy gems from the available pool to the spent pool), then takes the tile out and moves it to the end of the sliding track: If he wants to activate this unit again, it will cost him 8 gems, because the unit is now on position 8. The Opponent can activate a maximum of two tiles, and he regains only a certain number of gems each turn (depending on the scenario).&nbsp;In a typical scenario, the heroes need to accomplish something and the Opponent wins if the heroes fail to reach their objective &mdash; but in some scenarios, the Opponent has his own objectives and the Heroes win if they prevent him from accomplishing his goal. &nbsp; Players 2-5 Playing time 60 minutes Ages 14+",https://t.cfjump.com/33917/p/33973525,http://www.ozgameshop.com/strategy-board-games/conan-core-box?utm_source=commission+factory&amp;utm_medium=shopping&amp;utm_campaign=commission+factory+shopping+data+feed+(17/05/2017),http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33973525.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33973525@50x50.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33973525@100x100.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33973525@120x120.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33973525@200x200.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33973525@300x300.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33973525@400x400.jpg,133.99 AUD,Monolith,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The lands of the empire are made up of a vast range of climates, cultures and landscapes, each controlled by a sovereign City. Mob football is a game generally played between neighbouring towns and villages on feast days, which accounts for its popularity. At its core, players on opposing teams clash and struggle to control a leather wrapped inflated pig&#39;s bladder and attempt to kick it into the opponent&rsquo;s goal. The powerful Guilds took advantage of the huge popularity of the sport and invested great sums of money, creating professional teams and structured leagues.

However, mid to late game they need to be wary, especially if they lose a player or two.&nbsp;They excel at movement and kicking the ball - they are practically all about offense. Their combo play revolves around (re)positioning and exploitation of space.&nbsp;Whilst not entirely equipped with raw damage soaking defence, they instead have far subtler defensive options that focus much more on space control.&nbsp;&nbsp; This set provides you with all you need to start playing the Fishermanr&#39;s Guild.&nbsp;An excellent way of introducing yourself to the Guild Ball world and perfect to start enjoying the game right out of the box!

The lands of the empire are made up of a vast range of climates, cultures and landscapes, each controlled by a sovereign City. Mob football is a game generally played between neighbouring towns and villages on feast days, which accounts for its popularity. At its core, players on opposing teams clash and struggle to control a leather wrapped inflated pig&#39;s bladder and attempt to kick it into the opponent&rsquo;s goal. The powerful Guilds took advantage of the huge popularity of the sport and invested great sums of money, creating professional teams and structured leagues. The public went crazy as the game was elevated to new heights of spectacle. Guild Ball was born amidst a blaze of interest and publicity, and with it a whole new business and revenue stream for the Guilds. Games are now played out in front of immense crowds, whilst behind the scenes the results can mean fortunes are won or lost on the kick of a ball.&nbsp;&nbsp; Morticians&rsquo; play style is about planning and execution. They control play with a huge amount of influence at their disposal, along with the ability to steal more from their opponent. Their play feels very much like setting traps, triggering the snare and then punishing their opponent. Mid-game is where they really shine - once well laid plans have turned to mush, Morticians can begin to dictate the play. Morticians provide an interesting take on &lsquo;force projection&rsquo; by making their opponents consider how and where they&rsquo;re going to position models.&nbsp;Morticians will reward players who like to dominate and control the game by playing mind tricks on their opponents.&nbsp; This set provides you with all you need to start playing the Mortician&#39;s Guild.&nbsp;An excellent way of introducing yourself to the Guild Ball world and perfect to start enjoying the game right out of the box!

The Syrian player starts with a very strong force, but must attack at the right places and rely on rapid breakthrough across the Golan Heights in order to seize the objectives. Time is against the Syrians, with not only the Israeli reserves arriving, but also as the SAM barrier gets reduced and the effectiveness of the Israeli Air Force grows. The Syrians must strike hard and fast, then fight to hold on to their gains. &nbsp; Both players have a degree of variable setup that allows enhanced replay value, but still keeps the historical flavor.

Set in the Dystopian Universe, players take on the role of powerful crime bosses, building their criminal organizations by carefully recruiting new operatives with specialized skills and directing their team&rsquo;s nefarious deeds. All of your specialists are either in play or in your hand, ready to be used as you command. This unique hand-building mechanism gives you total control of your strategy. &nbsp; Grifters is all about stealing as much money as you can from the corrupt government, malicious corporations, and your rival players. Each player starts the game with a hand of six Specialist cards, each with unique abilities. Your objective is to use this team of six Specialists to recruit more criminals, complete jobs, steal from the government coffers and swindle your opponents. &nbsp; Each specialist has a special ability and skill. On your turn you can play a single specialist to perform their ability, or you can play a team of specialists to use their combined skills to complete a job. This means every specialist is a valuable asset to your criminal enterprise, earning immediate benefit through abilities and valuable end-game bonuses by completing jobs against the same target. And because all the cards in your deck are always available, you decide how to maximize your play. &nbsp; Grifters uses a unique card &quot;cooldown&quot; system to control the use of your cards. On your turn, you play one or more specialist cards into the first &quot;Night&quot; of your hideout. If you already have a specialist card, or a team of specialist cards, in night one those cards advance to night two and push other cards through your hideout. &nbsp; When a card is pushed out of the third night of your hideout it enters the refresh area. Any cards in your refresh area will return to your hand at the end of your turn. &nbsp; The game ends when the coffers run out of money, there are no more jobs left to complete, or if there are no more specialists cards left for recruiting. End game bonuses are calculated for completing multiple jobs against the same target.

Each face of the six-sided dice allows a different action: Gain new Favors, increase or decrease speed, change lanes, or attack opponents (either directly by hurling javelins or indirectly by dropping caltrops in their path). if the first roll is not satisfactory, the player may call on Fortuna to influence the dice, as long they have her favor. Once the result is set, the player moves their chariot forward according to the final speed they achieved and may then take actions against their rivals. &nbsp; However, breakneck racing and ramming are not without risk. If two chariots collide, they both take damage, and cornering at a wild gallop is not recommended. The further the safe speed is exceeded, the more damage is caused to the vehicle &ndash; which might fall apart in the middle of the arena if the driver is too careless, resulting in their elimination from the race. &nbsp; Players 2-6 Playing time 15-45 minutes Ages 8",https://t.cfjump.com/33917/p/33973590,http://www.ozgameshop.com/strategy-board-games/chariot-race?utm_source=commission+factory&amp;utm_medium=shopping&amp;utm_campaign=commission+factory+shopping+data+feed+(17/05/2017),http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33973590.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33973590@50x50.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33973590@100x100.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33973590@120x120.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33973590@200x200.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33973590@300x300.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33973590@400x400.jpg,39.49 AUD,Pegasus Entertainment,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The players are just internationally operating investors who act in the background. By giving money to the six powers, which all have their own treasuries, the players influence the politics. The biggest investor in each nation gains control of that nation&#39;s government and decides what the nation will do. As control of a government can change with each new investment, players may control several governments at the same time. As investors, players should not get too attached to their preferred nation, but rather focus on where their investments have the best rates of return. Essentially the game is about money, and not about military domination!&nbsp;Imperial 2030 was released at Essen 2009 by PD-Games and Rio Grande Games. Compared to &quot;Imperial&quot; there will be some new features: - new wooden bits - the Swiss Bank&nbsp;- a new 30 million bond to invest in - more neutral territory, generating higher taxation - fewer home provinces - control of canals (Panama and Suez).&nbsp;For those who already owned Imperial, there was the opportunity to get only the new map and bonds at Essen &#39;09, as it can be played with the old wooden bits as well.&nbsp; Players 2-6 Playing time 120 minutes Ages 12+",https://t.cfjump.com/33917/p/33973614,http://www.ozgameshop.com/strategy-board-games/imperial-2030?utm_source=commission+factory&amp;utm_medium=shopping&amp;utm_campaign=commission+factory+shopping+data+feed+(17/05/2017),http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33973614.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33973614@50x50.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33973614@100x100.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33973614@120x120.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33973614@200x200.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33973614@300x300.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33973614@400x400.jpg,83.79 AUD,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Slowly the Others have creeped into our lives, corrupting society from within. The city of Haven is the key to their invasion, but it will not go down without a fight, thanks to the actions of the paranormal organization known as F.A.I.T.H. (Federal Authority for the Interdiction of Transdimensional Horrors). Each session of The Others is played with one player controlling the forces of a single Sin, against the other players who control a team of 7 FAITH heroes. The heroes cooperate to survive the Sin&#39;s attacks and accomplish the missions set before them, while the Sin attempts to thwart the heroes in all ways (preferably by destroying them). &nbsp; The heroes are divided into different classes, each specialized in a different aspect of the game. Leaders are good at helping the other members of the team. Bruisers are excellent melee fighters. Snipers are experts at using guns to put down monsters from a distance. And Fixers have the resourcefulness and knowledge of the occult necessary to resolve supernatural crises that spread through the city. Each hero also has their own stats and unique abilities that set them apart from all others. Knowing when to bring in the right reinforcement can be key to FAITH&rsquo;s victory. &nbsp; Corruption is one of the main mechanics of the game. It is both a way for the Sin to consume heroes, and a way for heroes to accomplish amazing feats they wouldn&rsquo;t be capable of normally. Taking corruption grants heroes powerful bonuses (as long as they keep taking corruption), but when they become fully corrupted, their darkest secrets may come back to haunt them and tear the team from within, or their flesh might simply succumb to the sinful influences. &nbsp; The Sins player, on the other hand, has access to the different monsters of each Sin, including Abominations, a Controller, and the terrifying Avatar of Sin! These monsters can attempt to destroy the heroes, or simply hinder their progress on their missions. Each Sin provides the Sins Player with a different deck of Sins cards that can be played at different times to surprise players with different effects, often tied to the strategy of each Sin. Yes, because each Sin taints the game with an overarching mechanic that is always in effect. For example, Pride punishes prideful heroes that venture into the streets on their own, while Sloth punishes heroes who try to move quickly across the board. Heroes will need to learn to deal with the different influence of each Sin, which will always stand between them and their mission. &nbsp; The Sins are also aided by Acolytes, with each session using a different type. These lowly corrupted servants of darkness can fight and stand in the way of heroes, but they also have a once per round special ability that reflects their previous lives. For example, corrupted hobos take equipment from heroes, corrupted nuns corrupt the city districts, and corrupted doctors keep heroes from healing. &nbsp; There are 7 different stories that players can embark on for each session of The Others. Each of them brings different special rules, different dynamics, and a unique system of branching missions the heroes need to accomplish in order to be victorious. There are Terror stories, which are more straightforward, focusing on action and combat; Corruption stories revolve around the Corruption spreading through the city and the heroes themselves; and Redemption stories rely on saving the city and the few innocents that remain. Each story can be played on a different map setup, which further makes the dynamic of each session unique. &nbsp; The board used in The Others is made up of several tiles, each depicting a different city district and different configurations of streets. As the city of Haven still belongs to humanity, and it&rsquo;s the Sins that are attempting to take it over, the heroes can use it to get different benefits each district offers them. For example, they can go to the hospital to heal wounds, to the museum to get rid of corruption, to the RavenCorp tower to get new equipment, or to the police station to call in an orbital strike. What districts are available on each map, and their location, can greatly change the dynamic of the game. &nbsp; As the game progresses, and depending on how badly the heroes fare against storyline plot twists and developments, the Apocalypse Track will advance, making the Sins gradually stronger and more terrifying. Apocalypse cards, tied to the type of story being played (Terror, Corruption, or Redemption) introduce new twists and challenges to the game, even bringing in the members of the Hell Club themselves!&nbsp; Heroes will die. Either in noble sacrifice, torn apart by claws and tentacles, or consumed by the corruption welling up in their souls. The question is whether the FAITH team will manage to fulfill their final mission in time, or whether the Sins will reign supreme over humanity. &nbsp; Players 2-5 Playing time 90 minutes Ages 14",https://t.cfjump.com/33917/p/33973631,http://www.ozgameshop.com/miniature-board-games/the-others-core-box?utm_source=commission+factory&amp;utm_medium=shopping&amp;utm_campaign=commission+factory+shopping+data+feed+(17/05/2017),http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33973631.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33973631@50x50.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33973631@100x100.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33973631@120x120.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33973631@200x200.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33973631@300x300.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33973631@400x400.jpg,157.49 AUD,Cool Mini Or Not,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Your opponent knows that you are preparing a major strike, but do they know where? Suddenly you receive reports that a spy has gained information about your operation, and the enemy shifts their defensive forces. But do they know the full extent of your plans? Should you call off the invasion and plan for a new attack? Or risk disaster against a prepared enemy? This is the fog of war... &nbsp; The Fog of War is a two-player grand strategic game covering the European theater of World War II from 1940 to 1944. One player plays the Axis forces, and the other the Allies. &nbsp; The game does not have units that move around a map; instead the game focuses on the planning and intelligence aspects of the war. Each player has a deck of cards that represent the army, navy, and other assets of their nations. A map shows the 28 land and sea provinces over which the players are battling. &nbsp; You defend a province by placing cards face down on the map. If you wish to attack a province, you must plan an &quot;operation&quot; to do so by creating one on your operation wheel. The wheel is a unique way of forcing players to commit to operations in advance, while giving opportunities for intelligence gathering and bluffing. An operation consists of a province card that shows the target of the operation, plus one or more cards to conduct the attack. All of these cards are placed face down, so your opponent does not know the target of the operation or the strength of the cards that are taking part. Each turn, the dial on the operation wheel is rotated by one position. This controls when an operation can be launched and any attack or defense bonuses that apply. &nbsp; In addition to combat forces for attack or defense, you may also spend Intel tokens to look at your opponent&rsquo;s operations and defenses. &nbsp; Players 2 Playing time 90-120 minutes Ages 10",https://t.cfjump.com/33917/p/33973650,http://www.ozgameshop.com/strategy-board-games/fog-of-war?utm_source=commission+factory&amp;utm_medium=shopping&amp;utm_campaign=commission+factory+shopping+data+feed+(17/05/2017),http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33973650.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33973650@50x50.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33973650@100x100.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33973650@120x120.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33973650@200x200.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33973650@300x300.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33973650@400x400.jpg,96.49 AUD,Stronghold Games,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The game ends at the close of a round in which a player erects his/her eighth building. Players then tally their points, and the player with the highest score wins. &nbsp; Players start with a number of building cards in their hand; buildings come in five colors, with the purple buildings typically having a special ability and the other colored buildings providing a benefit when you play particular characters. At the start of each round, the player who was king the previous round discards one of the eight character cards at random, chooses one, then passes the cards to the next player, etc. until each player has secretly chosen a character. Each character has a special ability, and the usefulness of any character depends upon your situation, and that of your opponents. The characters then carry out their actions in numerical order: the assassin eliminating another character for the round, the thief stealing all gold from another character, the wizard swapping building cards with another player, the warlord optionally destroys a building in play, and so on. &nbsp; On a turn, a player earns two or more gold (or draws two building cards then discards one), then optionally constructs one building (or up to three if playing the architect this round). Buildings cost gold equal to the number of symbols on them, and each building is worth a certain number of points. In addition to points from buildings, at the end of the game a player scores bonus points for having eight buildings or buildings of all five colors. &nbsp; The expansion Citadels: The Dark City was initially released as a separate item, but the second edition of the game from Hans im Gl&uuml;ck (packaged in a tin box) and the third edition from Fantasy Flight Games included this expansion.

Luther criticized the selling of indulgences and stated that the Catholic doctrine of the merits of the saints had no foundation in the gospel. The &quot;Protestants&quot; soon incorporated doctrinal changes such as Sola Scriptura (Scripture alone) and Sola Fide (faith alone). These changes turned out to be not only theological, but also influential in the Reformation in other ways: the rise of nationalism, the Western Schism that eroded people&#39;s faith in the Papacy, the perceived corruption of the Roman Curia, the impact of humanism, and the new learning of the Renaissance that questioned much of traditional thought. The Roman Catholic church responded with a counter-reformation initiated by the Council of Trent.&nbsp;In the two-player game Sola Fide: The Reformation, by the renown design team of Jason Mathews and Christian Leonhard, players attempt to install Reformation in the Holy Roman Empire or try to prevent it, battling the Holy Roman Empire&#39;s Imperial Circles.&nbsp; Players 2 Playing time 45 minutes Ages 12+",https://t.cfjump.com/33917/p/33973653,http://www.ozgameshop.com/strategy-board-games/sola-fide-the-reformation?utm_source=commission+factory&amp;utm_medium=shopping&amp;utm_campaign=commission+factory+shopping+data+feed+(17/05/2017),http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33973653.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33973653@50x50.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33973653@100x100.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33973653@120x120.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33973653@200x200.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33973653@300x300.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33973653@400x400.jpg,80.99 AUD,Stronghold Games,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To set up, choose to use the black or copper side of the four game boards, then arrange them in a 2x2 square. Each game board shows nine dice, and once arranged the completed grid shows 36 dice, with the dice being numbered 1-6 and showing six colors, with each combination of number and color appearing exactly once. Roll the color die and number die to determine the starting location for the transparent robot, then mark this space with the transparent starting token. In a round, roll the two dice to determine the target space; you can mark this space with a transparent victory token or simply have everyone remember which space they&#39;re trying to reach. Everyone simultaneously tries to figure out how to move the robot to the target space, and to move the robot, it must move orthogonally to a space that shares either the color or number of its current location. If the robot starts on &quot;3-green&quot;, for example, it can move orthogonally to any space that shows either a 3 or is green; if you&#39;d move it to &quot;5-green&quot;, it can now once again move orthogonally to any space that shows either a 5 or is green; and so on. As soon as a player has a solution, they yell out the number of moves, then take the robot and demonstrate the solution. If the solution takes exactly the number of moves claimed, the player earns a victory token; if not, the player gives one of their victory tokens (if they have any) to the player with the fewest tokens. In either case, the former target space becomes the new starting space for the next round. If any player possesses five victory tokens, they win! If the 25 victory tokens are distributed before someone collects five, then whoever holds the most tokens wins, with ties being possible. Expert Micro Robots players can increase the challenge of the game by placing the target victory token on the board, then rolling the two dice once again. The players must now determine a solution that first moves the robot to the space showing on the dice, then to the final destination. The transparent robot in Micro Robots can also be used in Ricochet Robots. This robot moves like any other robot in that game except that for an additional move it can pass through a wall instead of stopping at it. It cannot move through the central barrier or the exterior walls, and the only target space on which it can land is the colored vortex. 2 - 99 Players 20 Min Playing Time Age: 8&nbsp;&nbsp;",https://t.cfjump.com/33917/p/33973672,http://www.ozgameshop.com/party-and-family-board-games/micro-robots-board-games?utm_source=commission+factory&amp;utm_medium=shopping&amp;utm_campaign=commission+factory+shopping+data+feed+(17/05/2017),http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33973672.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33973672@50x50.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33973672@100x100.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33973672@120x120.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33973672@200x200.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33973672@300x300.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33973672@400x400.jpg,28.99 AUD,Z-MAN GAMES,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

On one side are the Athenians and the Delian League, the Demos team; against them, the Oligarchs of Sparta and Corinth are teamed. The Peloponnesian War is a great setting for a historical game, having two evenly matched factions with very differing capabilities. Athens (and the Delian League, including Corcyra) commanded the seas, and relied on trade to feed their masses. On land, the Spartan phalanx was virtually unbeatable, as all adult Spartan male citizens were professional soldiers Players of Quartermaster General will find most of the concepts familiar. Since the game has a smaller maximum player count, the amount of activity during a turn has been slightly increased.For example, after the Play step there is a Planning step, when you can place a Prepare card on the table. Prepare cards in Victory or Death work a lot like Response Cards in Quartermaster General, but have a much broader scope of application. Many Prepare cards are used during the Strategy step, which is at the beginning of a player&#39;s turn.

The wilds of Aventuria hold more than just monsters. The land also supports many dangerous and interesting animals. Aventuria&rsquo;s oceans, skies, and fields are home to bloodthirsty striped sharks, arrow-swift storm falcons, and heavily armored, horned saurians, each a unique challenge for heroes who dare to explore the trackless wastes. Each creature description features a full stat block, a colorful illustration, and notes on physical traits, habitat, and encounter tips.

One player controls a vile king and his knightly lackeys who try to force their way into the castle through a mob of wrathful citizens. The other player controls the mob itself and more importantly three assassins who hide among the crowd hoping to kill or stop the ruler long enough for the people to deal with him using their bare fists. The king has only so much time before he is overpowered by his own subjects but using guile and swords of his guards he may be able to eliminate the assassins and hopefully escape into the safety of his palace.The gameplay is based upon Action Cards which show a limited number of Action Points available to both sides. First, the king and his knights move around the board securing their position or eliminating dangers by pushing aside the crowd, then the assassins hidden among the crowd prepare for their lethal strike by killing guards or making the king&#39;s progress slower. It&#39;s up to the players to make the most of the Action Points available in the current round. The king&#39;s player wins if he manages to escape from the board using one of the exits or if his knights eliminate all the assassins.

You need to manipulate, bluff and bribe your way to power. Your object is to destroy the influence of all the other families, forcing them into exile. Only one family will survive... In Coup, you want to be the last player with influence in the game, with influence being represented by face-down character cards in your playing area. Each player starts the game with two coins and two influence &ndash; i.e., two face-down character cards; the fifteen card deck consists of three copies of five different characters, each with a unique set of powers: Duke: Take three coins from the treasury. Block someone from taking foreign aid. Assassin: Pay three coins and try to assassinate another player&#39;s character. Contessa: Block an assassination attempt. Captain: Take two coins from another player, or block someone from stealing coins from you. Ambassador: Draw two character cards from the Court (the deck), choose which (if any) to exchange with your face-down characters, then return two. Block someone from stealing coins from you. On your turn, you can take any of the actions listed above, regardless of which characters you actually have in front of you, or you can take one of three other actions: Income: Take one coin from the treasury. Foreign aid: Take two coins from the treasury. Coup: Pay seven coins and launch a coup against an opponent, forcing that player to lose an influence. (If you have ten coins, you must take this action.) When you take one of the character actions &ndash; whether actively on your turn, or defensively in response to someone else&#39;s action &ndash; that character&#39;s action automatically succeeds unless an opponent challenges you. In this case, if you can&#39;t reveal the appropriate character, you lose an influence, turning one of your characters face-up. Face-up characters cannot be used, and if both of your characters are face-up, you&#39;re out of the game. If you do have the character in question, you reveal it, the opponent loses an influence, then you shuffle that character into the deck and draw a new one, perhaps getting the same character again and perhaps not.

Two to four summoners encounter each other in the Tash-Kalar arena, either in teams or each on his own, and prove their skill and strategy in a short but intense battle. By clever deployment of their minions, they create magic patterns for summoning powerful beings, and then use those to destroy their opponent&rsquo;s forces or to prepare patterns for the ultimate legendary beings. The game includes three different factions, each with a unique deck of beings to summon and one deck of legendary creatures. Players take turns placing their common pieces on the board, and if they succeed in creating patterns depicted on one of the cards in hand, they may play it. When played, the card summons a particular being and allows the player to perform an effect described on the card: a giant destroys neighboring pieces, a knight moves through enemy pieces, a warlord orders previously placed pieces to move and fight, an enchantress converts enemy pieces to player&#39;s own color, etc. After that, the player discards the card and the summoned being turns into a motionless piece which may be used in patterns for summoning other beings &ndash; or even be awakened and moved into combat by the effects of other cards. Tash-Kalar: Arena of Legends offers two game modes. In the standard mode you score points for fulfilling various quests set by the Arena Masters: controlling certain points or areas of the arena, destroying a number of enemy pieces in a single turn, performing a certain combination of summonings, etc. In melee mode, your only goal is to entertain the crowd. You do that by destroying your opponents and making them beg (i.e., making them use the catch-up mechanisms) and by summoning legendary beings. After all, people want to see a dragon! Both modes can be played as a two-player duel or as a team game with teammates sharing pieces and legendary cards, but with each controlling his own faction. (The game includes a duplicate of one faction in a different color.) The melee mode can also be played as a fierce free-for-all battle, but don&#39;t expect alliances; to achieve a good score, you need to destroy all opponents evenly as you track points scored on each opponent separately, and your lowest score is your final score. The rules of Tash-Kalar: Arena of Legends are simple and easy to understand, but as you start to discover the tactics and are able to anticipate the opponent&#39;s moves and patterns, it turns into a real clash of wits.",https://t.cfjump.com/33917/p/33973727,http://www.ozgameshop.com/rpg-and-fantasy-card-games/tash-kalar?utm_source=commission+factory&amp;utm_medium=shopping&amp;utm_campaign=commission+factory+shopping+data+feed+(17/05/2017),http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33973727.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33973727@50x50.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33973727@100x100.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33973727@120x120.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33973727@200x200.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33973727@300x300.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33973727@400x400.jpg,56.99 AUD,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Your Super Hero has an ability that will guide your strategy throughout the game. Each player starts with his own basic 10-card deck and draws a hand of 5 cards each turn. Power is the currency you will use to buy new, stronger cards to add to your deck. A large, central stack of cards supplies a five-card &ldquo;Line-Up&rdquo; from which players make their purchases. Each player will always have five face-up cards to choose from each turn, so every turn there are new options and surprises. When a player has amassed enough Power, he or she may defeat the current Super-Villain. When a Super-Villain is defeated, a new one appears and makes an Attack against each player in the game! Players can defend themselves with Defense cards like Force Field, the Helmet of Fate, or several others. In the end, the player who has accumulated the most Victory Points from the cards in his or her deck wins the game. This is the follow-up to the 2012 hit DC Comics Deck-building Game.

Aminia felt blind panic, like shadowed hands squeezing her desperately thudding heart up again her ribs and then-- nothing. Darkness. Silence. And one thought: They didnt save me.Suddenly, the light hit her eyelids with searing brightness as she snapped into life with a jolt. She gasped for air. Ms. Twain? Are you alright? Dr. Stinson asked quickly. Hiccups? Mr. Parsons asked in his usual, genial manner. She felt her stomach churn - how did she ever find that phony charisma so charming? She smiled weakly and nodded, feigning another hiccup, before excusing herself from the meeting for a cup of water. Shutting the door behind her, she melted, stunned, on the other side of the wall. The meeting continued on within the room behind her - they didnt even notice her absence.What happened? Her eyes darted around the familiar headquarters of the Freedom Five, but not everything seemed like how shed left it. Things were different. She was different. She had died. The darkness had lifted to unveil a changed world. Or perhaps, perhaps only she had changed? She went to the sink to fill the Worlds Finest Assistant&quot; mug Dr. Stinson gave her three years before they let her die. The handle had yet to crack.This world was most definitely different than the one she left, but no difference cast such a stark contrast as the difference she felt inside. No longer was she the devoted, sheepish secretary who alerted the Freedom Five to where trouble emerged, who placed orders for Tachyons many pairs of new footwear, who copied memos from the president, who washed sweaty spandex uniforms. Now, she was awake.Aminia straightened up her jacket and opened the door to return to the job she perfected in her previous life.

Every game is played over a series of rounds, as you and your opponents play character cards in an attempt to claim the Iron Throne for yourselves. In each round, you pursue your own plans and seek to foil your opponents by playing character cards. Each turn, you will play a character card from your hand, adding to the court at King&rsquo;s Landing. You can advance your own prospects by playing your character cards cleverly, but certain rules govern exactly where you can place your character cards. The first character cards must be played in a single row, forming the bottom row of the court. Once there are two cards in a row, you may play a card in a new row above them. The card that you play in the new row, however, must match the House of one of the two cards below it. In Game of Thrones: Westeros Intrigue, character cards are divided between House Stark, House Lannister, House Baratheon, and House Targaryen, and each player may have character cards from any of these Houses in his hand. The court develops as you and your opponents play cards, but a player will eventually discover that he can no longer legally play a character card. Once this occurs, that player is eliminated and the round continues. A round ends when no one can play another character card, and whoever played the last character card wins the round. In Game of Thrones: Westeros Intrigue, you will play rounds equal to the number of players. If you win a round of Game of Thrones: Westeros Intrigue, you reap the rewards by drawing an Iron Throne card, which cancels a number of your penalty points. Your opponents, on the other hand, must take penalty points equal to the number of character cards that they have left in their hand. Over the course of the game, players gain penalty points from having character cards at the end of the round, and reduce their penalty points by winning a round and drawing an Iron Throne card. At the end of the game, the player with the least penalty points wins!

Battle is inevitable in the grim future of the 41st millenium and Warhammer 40,000 Conquest. Once the command struggle resolves at each planet, battles occur at the first planet and on any planet where a warlord is present. Winning a battle at the first planet allows you to capture the planet, bringing you one step closer to victory. Battles at other planets allow you to establish footholds for future battles or crush your opponent&#39;s troops that have massed on another planet. Seven different factions compete for control of the Traxis sector in Warhammer 40,000 Conquest. Each faction occupies a niche in the game, with its own distinct playstyle. Even in the darkness of the far future though alliances can be forged. Each of the seven factions has its own place on the games alignment wheel and this determines which factions might join you. When building a deck for your chosen faction you may choose one of the two factions adjacent to your warlord&#39;s to serve as your ally in your deck. Warhammer 40,000 Conquest offers you command of one of the seven factions, battling for riches and glory in the newly discovered Traxis sector. Will your army rise triumphant from the interplanetary warfare? Or will your name be forgotten as your armies fall in battle? Make your mark on the galaxy in this Living Card Game of strategy and martial tactics in the darkness of the far future!

Here is a run down on what is new in the 2nd edition release: Backwards compatibility is completely maintained between editions. You can use 2nd Edition with your original edition core game and vice versa. The 2nd Edition core game has a sturdy new telescoping box, while 2nd edition expansions have double width tuckboxes. Timing icons in the style of Cthulhu Gloom and Unquiet Dead are incorporated throughout the 2nd Edition Rules cards and icon reminder cards are included in each 2nd Edition for easy reference The card list and the effect texts of individual cards have been polished for a better play experience. For example complex cards like &quot;Body Theif&quot; and cards with delayed effects have been removed. Three Modifiers have been turned into Transformations in Unwelcome Guests 2nd Edition Residences and Mysteries have been reworked in the 2nd Edition so that you can no longer end up with unusable cards in your hand. All the story icons and few family icons in the 2nd edition have been redrawn by artist Todd Remick. Gloom 2nd Edition uses the discard rule from Cthulhu Gloom Death cards in the 2nd edition have a central art piece, as Cthulhu Gloom does as well as a blank story icon at the top right. Characters no longer flip upon death. Event cards in the 2nd Edition have a center illustration and a blank icon in the top right spot to give them the silhouette as a Death Card. Guests in the 2nd Edition have reminder text in the family icon spot, as Cthulhu Gloom does. Pathos Points are now called Self-Worth Points to avoid unnecessary proliferation of game terms. A number of mechanical changes have been made in the rule sheet. For example timing icons, symbols on Event cards and the new discard rule have been accounted for.&nbsp; The world of Gloom is a sad and benighted place. The sky is gray, the tea is cold, and a new tragedy lies around every corner. Debt, disease, heartache, and packs of rabid flesh-eating mice&mdash;just when it seems like things can&#39;t get any worse, they do. But some say that one&#39;s reward in the afterlife is based on the misery endured in life. If so, there may yet be hope&mdash;if not in this world, then in the peace that lies beyond.&nbsp;In the Gloom card game, you assume control of the fate of an eccentric family of misfits and misanthropes. The goal of the game is sad, but simple: you want your characters to suffer the greatest tragedies possible before passing on to the well-deserved respite of death. You&#39;ll play horrible mishaps like Pursued by Poodles or Mocked by Midgets on your own characters to lower their Self-Worth scores, while trying to cheer your opponents&#39; characters with marriages and other happy occasions that pile on positive points. The player with the lowest total Family Value wins.&nbsp;Printed on transparent plastic cards, Gloom features an innovative design by noted RPG author Keith Baker. Multiple modifier cards can be played on top of the same character card; since the cards are transparent, elements from previously played modifier cards either show through or are obscured by those played above them. You&#39;ll immediately and easily know the worth of every character, no matter how many modifiers they have. You&#39;ve got to see (through) this game to believe it!&nbsp;Each of the three expansions for Gloom adds one more player, thus with all three expansions, this should be playable with seven players.",https://t.cfjump.com/33917/p/33973812,http://www.ozgameshop.com/strategy-card-games/gloom-2nd-edition-card-game?utm_source=commission+factory&amp;utm_medium=shopping&amp;utm_campaign=commission+factory+shopping+data+feed+(17/05/2017),http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33973812.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33973812@50x50.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33973812@100x100.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33973812@120x120.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33973812@200x200.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33973812@300x300.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33973812@400x400.jpg,31.99 AUD,ATLAS,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

How to find out which nephew should be rich? You will each be given a large amount of money and whoever can spend it first will be the rightful heir. Visit the most exclusive theatres or eat in the most expensive restaurants. Buy old properties for the price of new ones and sell them as ruins. Host a huge party in your mansion or on your private boat. Spend like your life would depend on it. Spend to become rich! If you're the first to run through the money on hand, you'll receive the rest of his inheritance &ndash; oh, and win the game. In Last Will, each player starts with a certain amount of money, an individual player board, two errand boys and two cards in some combination of properties and helpers. At the start of each round, lay out cards from the appropriate decks on the offering boards; the four regular decks are properties, companions, events, helpers and expenses, with special cards forming a deck of their own. The particular mix of cards varies by round and by the number of players. Each player then chooses a plan for the round, with each plan indicating the number of cards the player draws (drawn immediately from the four regular decks in any combination), how many errand boys he can use later (one or two), the number of actions available to him that round, and his spot in the playing order that round. In the playing order for that round, players then take turns choosing an action with their errand boy(s), with those actions being: Take a card on display and add it to your hand. Draw a card from any regular deck &ndash; This can be chosen only once by each player. Visit the opera and spend $2. Adjust the value modifiers in the property market. Take a player board extension, thereby giving you room to play more cards. Players then take actions in the playing order for that round, with each player having as many actions as indicated on his plan. Actions let you play one-time events (which have a cost, possibly variable); helpers and recurring expenses (which are placed on your individual player board); and properties (which cost money and may depreciate over time). You can often play companions with events or recurring expenses &ndash; of course you should bring a date to the opera or a horse on your yacht! &ndash; to increase their cost. You can also use actions to activate cards on your player board, possibly with one or more companions and always with the goal of spending money. Helpers and special cards can provide you with unique powers to further boost your profligacy. At the end of each round, you must discard down to two cards in hand, and properties that can depreciate do so; this is good as a player cannot go bankrupt if he owns properties, and the only way to get rid of properties is to sell them, which regretably puts money back in your hands unless the depreciation was intense or you manipulate the market. If a player has no money and no properties, he declares bankruptcy and the game ends at the conclusion of that round; otherwise the game ends after seven rounds. The player who has the least money (or even who is most in debt) wins.",https://t.cfjump.com/33917/p/33973822,http://www.ozgameshop.com/strategy-card-games/last-will?utm_source=commission+factory&amp;utm_medium=shopping&amp;utm_campaign=commission+factory+shopping+data+feed+(17/05/2017),http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33973822.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33973822@50x50.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33973822@100x100.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33973822@120x120.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33973822@200x200.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33973822@300x300.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33973822@400x400.jpg,56.99 AUD,Iello,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Players can win the game by winning 2 rounds or get eliminated from the game by losing 2 rounds. Each player has a 2-sided players card that has a white side and a red side. The first win taps the player card and the 1st loss flips the card over to the red side. A 2nd loss will have the player turn the card back into the box.&nbsp;The game is played in rounds. The player sets up the base character and all the equipment equipped. This represents every player as a fully equipped dungeon delver.&nbsp;Each round, the start player (the person who challenged the dungeon last or the last player to be in a dungeon) can choose to draw a card from the monster deck or pass their turn.&nbsp;If they choose to draw, they can do one of two things -- keep it and de-equip an equipment or place it face down in the dungeon. Placing it face down in the dungeon creates the dungeon deck and fills the dungeon with monsters that the challenger will have to face later. If they choose to pass their turn, they cannot participate in the rest of the round. Once only one person is left after all the other players have passed their turn, that player then becomes the challenger and must go into the dungeon with only the equipment he has equipped.&nbsp;The player then flips cards off the dungeon deck and fights the monsters within. Some equipment allow you to null the enemy damage or be able to withstand it by increasing your HP. If the player survives the dungeon with at least 1 HP, they win that round. If not, they lose. The players then reshuffles all the cards to make a new monster deck and re-equips all the equipment to start a new round.&nbsp;The game ends when someone has won twice or one player is the last man standing.&nbsp; Players 2-4 Suggested Ages 10 Playing Time 30 minutes",https://t.cfjump.com/33917/p/33973880,http://www.ozgameshop.com/rpg-and-fantasy-card-games/welcome-to-the-dungeon-card-game?utm_source=commission+factory&amp;utm_medium=shopping&amp;utm_campaign=commission+factory+shopping+data+feed+(17/05/2017),http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33973880.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33973880@50x50.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33973880@100x100.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33973880@120x120.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33973880@200x200.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33973880@300x300.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33973880@400x400.jpg,21.99 AUD,Iello,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Take orders for the tables in your section, gather the plates to fill those orders, and serve your tables, and do it as quickly as possible while showing up the other players. Diner features a pseudo-real time mechanic that has players passing action tokens whenever they take an action; if a player does not have a token, that player can&#39;t take an action. At times, action tokens may accumulate in front of a player, allowing them to take multiple actions at once. Diner is the winner of the Dice Hate Me Games 54-Card Challenge - a contest that challenged designers to create a game using only 54 cards and very minimal components. It was selected as winner among over 100 participants. Additional description from interview posted at: http://boardgamegeek.com/blogpost/28649/chris-kirkman-on-his-family-of-rabbits Diner puts players in the shoes of someone serving patrons at a greasy spoon. The goal is to earn the most in tips by gathering plates of various types from the kitchen and then serving them to a table of patrons in your section demanding certain orders. The real magic of the game is in the pseudo-real time action system. When you want to take an action - say, seat a table in your section - you have to have an action token in front of you. When you perform the action you pass the token to the player next to you. Sometimes those action tokens can pile up allowing you to do multiple things at once. Other times you&rsquo;re urging the other players to hurry up a bit so you can serve your tables. It&rsquo;s a very madcap, social experience, with lots of table talk. With the action tokens, though, it&rsquo;s not total chaos like many real-time games - there is a lot of of control worked into the mechanics. It&rsquo;s a brilliant design, and one that will appeal to many gamers whether they like real-time games or not.

With her keen intellect and supreme control over telekinesis she can manipulate the world around her. She is more of a lone warrior, but her powers more than make up for her lack of creature support. All battles are won in the mind first, and the Forcemaster has the greatest mind of all.&nbsp;The Warlord is a master of the art of War, trained in both the War and Earth schools of magic. Strong soldiers bend to his every wish, goblin minions build siege towers and manufacture devastating demolitions, and his retinue of legendary warriors follow him wherever he goes. The Warlord is first and foremost a commander of troops.

Nearly 90% of the world&rsquo;s population was eliminated, driving the survivors to band together into loose communities and tribes.&nbsp;In Arctic Scavengers, you are the leader of a small tribe of survivors. Resources, tools, medicine, and mercenaries are all in scarce supply. You and your tribe are pitted against up to four other tribes in a fight for survival. Build up your tribe, skirmish against other players head-to-head, or even bluff your way to victory. The player with the largest tribe at the end of the game is declared the winner!&nbsp;As the competing tribes develop and grow, headquarters are established for each tribe thanks to the components in the included HQ expansion. This base camp consists of a Tribal Leader (complete with special abilities) and the potential to construct buildings that can be used strategically during game play. Additionally, the game introduces alternative victory paths, new mercenaries, new tools, and the addition of the &quot;engineering schematics&quot; pile.&nbsp;As the tribes evolve further and struggle for dominance, information becomes the most valuable currency. In the new world mapped out in the Recon, deception reigns, leading to a need for reconnaissance.

Before each game players choose five character roles from a randomized deck. Characters have a unique variable power, and the deck is formed by three iterations of each role for fifteen cards total.&nbsp;A player starts the game with two coins and two influence cards &ndash; i.e., two face-down character cards. On your turn, you can take any of the actions of the five characters in play, regardless of which characters you actually have in front of you, or you can take one of two general actions:&nbsp;Income: Take one coin from the treasury. Coup: Pay seven coins and launch a coup against an opponent, forcing that player to lose an influence. (If you have ten coins or more, you must take this action.) When you take one of the character actions &ndash; whether actively on your turn, or defensively in response to someone else&#39;s action &ndash; that character&#39;s action automatically succeeds unless an opponent challenges you. In this case, if you can&#39;t (or don&#39;t) reveal the appropriate character, you lose an influence, turning one of your characters face-up. Face-up characters cannot be used, and if both of your characters are face-up, you&#39;re out of the game.&nbsp;If you do have the character in question and choose to reveal it, the opponent loses an influence, then you shuffle that character into the deck and draw a new one, perhaps getting the same character again and perhaps not.&nbsp;The last player to still have influence &ndash; that is, a face-down character &ndash; wins the game!&nbsp;Coup: Rebellion G54 is a new standalone game that takes the same simple Coup mechanisms and rules, but with a variable deck of 25 characters, and in each game you choose to play with five out of the 25, so the relative power and advantage of each character changes from game to game.

Football had become the predominant national pastime &mdash; that is until the year 2032, the year baseball decided to revolutionize the game and regain the throne! Starting in 2032, baseball games were shortened to six innings. Pitchers were encouraged to have bionic arm implants to improve their pitching. These cyborgs, or &#39;Borgs as they&#39;re affectionately known, were immediately popular and soon ruled the league. In 2041, robotic players were introduced to get more offense back into the game. These robots were similar to designated hitters in that they were used only to bat and did not field. However, recent reports indicate fielding &#39;Bots are on the way. Now in 2045, human players are still in the game and known as Naturals. They are the best fielders by far but are sorely challenged when it comes to hitting and pitching. Some Naturals have learned to hit by swinging before the pitcher starts his windup, which gives them a chance to hit the ball. Although it&#39;s hard for a Natural to get into the league, those who do are popular. Many Naturals have named themselves after the great players of pre-2032 baseball by taking a first and last name borrowed from different star players of the past. The fans love them, and their presence on the team ensures good revenue! The stage is now set! The fans are energized and root fanatically for their new favorites, be they &#39;Bots, &#39;Borgs or Naturals! Baseball Highlights: 2045 is like watching TV highlights of early 21st-century baseball games, with the gameplay being full of theme with no outs or innings and without bogging down in a play-by-play baseball simulation. In this quick and interactive game, two players build their teams as they play, combining both strategy (building your team) and tactics (playing the game) without any of the downtime. During each &quot;mini-game&quot;, each player alternates playing six cards to simulate a full game&#39;s highlights. The mini-game includes defensive and offensive actions, and your single card play may include elements of defensive and/or offensive plays. Do you try to thwart your opponent&#39;s pending hits, put up strong offensive action of your own, or use your better players to do both? Players buy new free agents after each mini-game to improve their roster, and the team who wins the most mini-games in the series is the champ!",https://t.cfjump.com/33917/p/33973969,http://www.ozgameshop.com/strategy-card-games/baseball-highlights-2045?utm_source=commission+factory&amp;utm_medium=shopping&amp;utm_campaign=commission+factory+shopping+data+feed+(17/05/2017),http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33973969.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33973969@50x50.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33973969@100x100.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33973969@120x120.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33973969@200x200.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33973969@300x300.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33973969@400x400.jpg,61.99 AUD,Eagle-Gryphon Games,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Each player attempts to build the best civilization through careful resource management, discovering new technologies, electing the right leaders, building wonders and maintaining a strong military. Weakness in any area can be exploited by your opponents. The game takes place throughout the ages beginning in the age of antiquity and ending in the modern age.&nbsp;One of the primary mechanisms in TTA is card drafting. Technologies, wonders, and leaders come into play and become easier to draft the longer they are in play. In order to use a technology you will need enough science to discover it, enough food to create a population to man it and enough resources (ore) to build the building to use it. While balancing the resources needed to advance your technology you also need to build a military. Military is built in the same way as civilian buildings. Players that have a weak military will be preyed upon by other players. There is no map in the game so you cannot lose territory, but players with higher military will steal resources, science, kill leaders, take population or culture. It is very difficult to win with a large military, but it is very easy to lose because of a weak one.&nbsp;Victory is achieved by the player whose nation has the most culture at the end of the modern age.

In Produce, players can repair damaged worlds and donate goods to the war effort (earning VPs). Players can also earn VP awards by defeating their share of the Xeno attackers and having the highest military vs Xenos, while they lose the use of damaged worlds that they fail to defend (until they are repaired).

Their daughter couldn&rsquo;t talk yet, but she &ldquo;spoke&rdquo; to machines. More alarmingly, when she did, they fell into their components, which created a metallic cocoon for the child. None of this was covered by the parenting classes the Moore family had attended. A representative of a group called the Ironclad Project offered to take care of Evelyn, but only if her parents were willing to sign her over to the care of the project. Seeing no other option, they agreed, and Evelyn became the ward of the Ironclad Project.&nbsp;Years went by, and Evelyn grew, learning to control her powers. She was told that she was being trained to be a part of the army. A new army that fought with better power instead of hundreds of soldiers. However, her lack of control and her hot-headedness meant that the Ironclad Project had little use for her. She had learned to absorb tech to plate herself in steel and coat her skin in wires, talking to the tech as easily as she talked to herself, but it wasn&rsquo;t enough. Even though she desperately wanted to prove her worth, those monitoring her kept wanting more than she could give.&nbsp;Then, one day, she absorbed a tank.&nbsp;There had been talk of military training going on in the adjacent facility, and Evelyn wanted to know more. Sneaking past her monitors, she found herself next to a massive M1 Abrams tank. It spoke to her of cold steel and internal combustion. It sounded beautiful to her. So she let it fall into its pieces, and she wore its skin.&nbsp;All hell broke loose in the army base. A tank had just fallen apart, and a person-shaped pile of plate-steel walked out of the wreckage. Soldiers opened fire on the figure, who ran through a wall, disappearing into the nearby hills.&nbsp;Since then, Choke has been a regular opponent of the Freedom Five and their allies. She is frequently at the heart of troubles concerning military installations or stockpiles of weapons. It was hardly surprising that she ended up allying with the Vengeful Five when Baron Blade called. But when she was fatally wounded by K.N.Y.F.E., many believed that would be the end of Choke.&nbsp;However, Choke had heard a peculiar voice - unlike any she had heard before. The Freedom Five had recently prevented Deadline from destroying the earth, and the alien&rsquo;s odd device was still housed in their headquarters. And she could hear its voice. It could save her, and she could give it purpose once again.&nbsp;Evelyn drew the resonating crystal at the heart of the device into herself, sealing her wound, but also opening her mind to the powers of the alien tech. It could sense weak points. She was originally trained to save the world, and now she knew how. She would show those at Project Ironclad that she was worthwhile after all.

While working on The Road Darkens, I found myself saying things like, &ldquo;This will have to go in the Nightmare version&rdquo; whenever I had to cut something that I liked. For example, serious fans of The Lord of the Rings may have lamented the exclusion of the Watcher in the Water&rsquo;s many tentacles, or the absence of the Balrog&rsquo;s fiery whip and flaming sword.

Each round is a magical duel between all the wizards, which includes six different types of magic: Blades, Fireball, Frost Wave, Lightning, Quake and Metamagic. These magic types will aid wizards in their duel. &nbsp; Players take turns casting an initial spell that will set the rule for the round, set the rank other players must beat, and earn them a potential Shard (VP). Players then take turns playing cards of equal or higher rank from their hands to the table; if they match the spell suit, they place a Shard on that card. The round ends when a player can no longer play a valid card from their hand. The player that could not play a card returns any Shards on their played cards back to the center, then takes card damage equal to the amount of Shards that are still on cards. All other players then take the Shards on cards they played to their Victory Pool. The player who played the last card gets a bonus Shard. &nbsp; When a player takes damage, they draw cards from the deck equal to the amount of damage and place them face down in front of them.

However, they don&#39;t get far before they hear the distant howling of wargs.

Their towering oliphaunts may give the heroes an advantage, however, even their oliphaunts cannot keep the heroes safe for long from the warg-riders and their barbed arrows. Instead, their only choice is to quicken their pace and race toward the Ford of Harnen. There, the heroes&#39; massive oliphaunts might be able to crash through waters too deep for the wargs to cross&hellip;&nbsp;Featuring scenario-specific rules that allow the Orcs and wargs to pursue the heroes from their own staging area, Race Across Harad brings this frantic chase to life in dramatic fashion, as you and your friends need to progress through your quest stages more quickly than the Orcs progress through their own.&nbsp;Simultaneously, the Adventure Pack introduces a new D&uacute;nedain hero in the Lore sphere, as well as three copies each of nine different player cards that enhance a wide range of the game&#39;s existing keywords, Traits, and mechanics.

On a turn, a player plays as many cards as desired by paying the cost of each card &mdash; that is, discarding cards of the proper colors that match the cost of the card being played &mdash; then placing the card in an empty slot on their side of the game board. Many cards have powers that take effect when played. &nbsp; After playing cards on a turn, each card does damage equal to its strength to any opponent&#39;s card on the other side of the game board. If no opponent&#39;s card is present, then with military power the player does damage directly to the opponent, swinging a pendulum of strength in their favor. If you reach a total of 7 on the pendulum, you win. Your troops can also grant you an additional card at the end of the turn (three instead of two) or tokens that make it cheaper to play cards. &nbsp; Instead of winning via military, you can instead win by having all six slots on your side of the board filled with cards at the start of your turn.

Coudray&#39;s mysterious and enchanting images are heavily influenced by early twentieth century design, from the Art Deco movement to Surrealism, even while they convey stories and ideas that may be millennia old.

Each other player then chooses one card in her own hand and gives it to the Storyteller in secret. These cards are shuffled and revealed, then players vote on which card was played by the Storyteller. If either no one or everyone votes for the Storyteller, then he receives no points; if he received some votes but not all of the votes, he scores based on the number of votes received.

And then the day came when the Cylons decided to kill their masters. After a long and bloody struggle, an armistice was declared and the Cylons left for another world to call their own.&nbsp;Forty years later, they returned, and brought humanity to the brink of extinction. The remaining humans, led by the crew of the Battlestar Galactica, fled in hope of finding a new home, one known by legend as Earth.&nbsp;Humanity&rsquo;s only hope lies in finding Earth&rsquo;s location while fighting off the unrelenting Cylons. But as resources run low, it is discovered that the enemy can now appear human and has infiltrated the fleet from the inside.&nbsp;Battlestar Galactica: The Board Game provides a unique gaming experience. Unlike most games where players win individually, Battlestar Galactica is a cooperative game, with the added complication that one or more of the players is a secret Cylon traitor &ndash; your entire side will win or lose, and you might not even be certain who is on your side until the game ends!&nbsp;Each player is secretly assigned his or her loyalty at the start of the game. Players will either be loyal to the humans, or to the Cylons. Humans and Cylons have specific and conflicting winning objectives. The human players win by reaching Kobol, but the Galactica will be threatened by a host of challenges along the way. Only through the cooperation of the humans will the ship (and fleet) survive. The Cylon player(s) wins by either destroying the Galactica with attacks from the Cylon fleet, or, through sabotage, by reducing one of the necessary resources (Food, Fuel, Population, or Morale) to zero.&nbsp;Either all of the humans win together, or all of the Cylons win together&hellip;but both sides must figure out who they can trust in order to achieve victory.&nbsp;Players&#39; identities are secret and no one will know for certain at the beginning of the game who they can trust. Keep your eyes open and watch how the other players play. Can you trust them to watch out for Humanity&rsquo;s interests? Or are they Cylons bent on destroying Humanity?&nbsp; If you enjoy highly-thematic political intrigue, handle some good-natured infighting and backstabbing, you&#39;ll enjoy Battlestar Continuous challenge, and victory is always a very close call 2-3 hours playing time 3-6 players Suitable for ages 10",https://t.cfjump.com/33917/p/33974355,http://www.ozgameshop.com/strategy-board-games/battlestar-galactica-board-game?utm_source=commission+factory&amp;utm_medium=shopping&amp;utm_campaign=commission+factory+shopping+data+feed+(17/05/2017),http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33974355.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33974355@50x50.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33974355@100x100.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33974355@120x120.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33974355@200x200.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33974355@300x300.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33974355@400x400.jpg,69.99 AUD,FANTASY FLIGHT GAMES,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Set in the not-so-distant future, battles are now fought by machines of destruction, known as MODS, for short. Human commanders still lead these mechanized troops, but these commanders each have special powers and abilities. These come into play via the use of Command cards, which really add a whole new dimension to the game and gives it a much-needed face-lift. Now, the battle is not just for the earth, but the sea and moon are also battlegrounds.&nbsp;Although much has been added, the basic flavor of the game is still Risk. One very welcome change has been the institution of a five-turn game limit, which allows the game to play to completion in about three hours. Further, players must also factor in economics in the form of energy. This energy is used to purchase Command cards, bid for Turn Order and purchase new commanders. There is much more strategy and planning involved in this new version, but it should still appeal to the classic Risk fans.",https://t.cfjump.com/33917/p/33974381,http://www.ozgameshop.com/strategy-board-games/risk-2210-ad?utm_source=commission+factory&amp;utm_medium=shopping&amp;utm_campaign=commission+factory+shopping+data+feed+(17/05/2017),http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33974381.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33974381@50x50.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33974381@100x100.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33974381@120x120.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33974381@200x200.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33974381@300x300.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33974381@400x400.jpg,73.99 AUD,Hasbro,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

From our branch offices in this monument of human achievement, NBN proudly broadcasts all your favorite media programming. We offer fully comprehensive streaming in music and threedee, news and sitcoms, classic movies and sensies. We cover it all. Ours is a brave new age, and as humanity hurtles into space and the future with an astonishing series of new advances every day, NBN and our affiliates are keeping pace, bringing you all the vid that&#39;s fit to view. Android: Netrunner is an asymmetrical Living Card Game for two players. Set in the cyberpunk future of Android and Infiltration, the game pits a megacorporation and its massive resources against the subversive talents of lone runners. Corporations seek to score agendas by advancing them. Doing so takes time and credits. To buy the time and earn the credits they need, they must secure their servers and data forts with &quot;ice&quot;. These security programs come in different varieties, from simple barriers, to code gates and aggressive sentries. They serve as the corporation&#39;s virtual eyes, ears, and machine guns on the sprawling information superhighways of the network. In turn, runners need to spend their time and credits acquiring a sufficient wealth of resources, purchasing the necessary hardware, and developing suitably powerful ice-breaker programs to hack past corporate security measures. Their jobs are always a little desperate, driven by tight timelines, and shrouded in mystery. When a runner jacks-in and starts a run at a corporate server, he risks having his best programs trashed or being caught by a trace program and left vulnerable to corporate countermeasures. It&#39;s not uncommon for an unprepared runner to fail to bypass a nasty sentry and suffer massive brain damage as a result. Even if a runner gets through a data fort&#39;s defenses, there&#39;s no telling what it holds. Sometimes, the runner finds something of value. Sometimes, the best he can do is work to trash whatever the corporation was developing. The first player to seven points wins the game, but not likely before he suffers some brain damage or bad publicity. Monolithic megacorps and individualistic netrunners collide in a dystopian future. Set in the gritty, cyberpunk future of Android, Android: Netrunner is a two-player Living Card Game that rewards skill, strategy, and just the right amount of calculated risk. This asymmetrical card game resurrects the mechanics of the original Netrunner, designed by Richard Garfield, and updates them to increase clarity and promote a more dynamic play environment&nbsp; High-stakes futuristic gambles and intrigues in a cyberpunk setting Four corporations and three runner classes spark imaginative deck designs Playing time 30-60 mins Ages 13 2 Players",https://t.cfjump.com/33917/p/33974383,http://www.ozgameshop.com/rpg-and-fantasy-card-games/android-netrunner-living-card-game?utm_source=commission+factory&amp;utm_medium=shopping&amp;utm_campaign=commission+factory+shopping+data+feed+(17/05/2017),http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33974383.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33974383@50x50.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33974383@100x100.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33974383@120x120.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33974383@200x200.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33974383@300x300.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33974383@400x400.jpg,55.99 AUD,FANTASY FLIGHT GAMES,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Tiles represent troops and troops make up units in your army: just determine the size of the battle and create your own army from a pool of existing troops. Each tile hits on certain rolls, and some can only melee while others can shoot. Some tiles also have special traits which can affect their whole unit or their whole army. Armies fight in three sectors the battlefield. The goal is to eliminate at least half the value of your opponent&#39;s army.

But wait ? these aren&#39;t the knights of old but rather their children. Can these newcomer knights prove up to the task of tracking the dangers out there and putting a stop to them before it&#39;s too late? In Shadows over Camelot: The Card Game the players (mostly) work together to complete quests before the danger level of a quest gets too high. In game terms the quests are represented by five types of cards with each card showing 1-3 swords as well as a number from 1 to 4 or a question mark. These cards are shuffled together with Morgan le Fay cards (which curse the players when they appear) and Merlin cards (which remove some aspects of the curse) to form the rumor deck. Each player receives a secret loyalty card at the start of the game with at most one person being a traitor to the cause. On a turn a player either: Reveals a rumor card. Attempts a quest. Accuses a knight. To reveal a rumor card the player flips it onto the top of the revealed stack of cards. If it&#39;s a quest card players try to keep track of the total value of cards from that quest with ?s each worth as many points as the number of ?s revealed of that quest. If a Morgan le Fay is revealed players can no longer speak to one another; in addition Morgan twists the values of some cards or removes some from play. Merlin allows players to speak once again. Players are trying to stop quests when the total value is 11 12 or 13. Any lower and they arrived too soon wasting time; any higher and they arrived too late. To attempt a quest the player points to the top quest card and says It&#39;s time. The player then reveals all cards in the deck. If the sum of that quest is 11-13 then the players receive 1-3 white swords as shown on the quest cards. If lower they receive one black sword; if higher 1-3 black swords.&nbsp;,https://t.cfjump.com/33917/p/33974465,http://www.ozgameshop.com/rpg-and-fantasy-board-games/shadows-over-camelot-the-card-game?utm_source=commission+factory&amp;utm_medium=shopping&amp;utm_campaign=commission+factory+shopping+data+feed+(17/05/2017),http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33974465.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33974465@50x50.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33974465@100x100.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33974465@120x120.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33974465@200x200.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33974465@300x300.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33974465@400x400.jpg,18.99 AUD,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In each game, players choose one of five factions and at the start of the game, each of these factions gains the ability to break one minor rule. When factions are chosen, players must pick one of their two powers, affix that power&rsquo;s sticker to their faction card, then destroy other rule card.

Instead of winning by competing with other players like most games, everyone must work together to win the game. Players take turns moving their pawns around the &#39;island&#39;, which is built by arranging the many beautifully screen-printed tiles before play begins. As the game progresses, more and more island tiles sink, becoming unavailable, and the pace increases. Players use strategies to keep the island from sinking, while trying to collect treasures and items. As the water level rises, it gets more difficult- sacrifices must be made. What causes this game to truly stand out among co-op and competitive games alike is the extreme detail that has been paid to the physical components of the game. It comes in a sturdy and organized tin of good shelf storage size. The plastic treasure pieces and wooden pawns are well crafted and they fit just right into the box. The cards are durable, well printed, and easy to understand. The island tiles are the real gem: they are screen-printed with vibrant colors, each with a unique and pleasing image. With multiple levels of difficulty, different characters to choose from (each with a special ability of their own), many optional island formats and game variations available, Forbidden Island has huge replay value. The game can be played by as few as two players and up to four (though it can accommodate five). More players translates into a faster and more difficult game, though the extra help can make all the difference. This is a fun game, tricky for players of almost any age. Selling for under twenty dollars, oddly, Forbidden Island is a rare game of both quality and affordable price.

To set up the game, players choose a number of hero decks &ndash; Spider-Man, Hulk, Cyclops, Wolverine, etc. &ndash; and shuffle them together; since players use only a handful of hero decks out of the fifteen included, the hero deck can vary widely in terms of what&#39;s available. Players then choose a mastermind villain (Magneto, Loki, Dr. Doom, etc.), stack that particular villain&#39;s attack cards underneath it, then modify the villain deck as needed based on that villain&#39;s particular scheme. Over the course of the game, players will recruit powerful hero cards to add to their deck in order to build a stronger and more resourceful deck. Players need to build both their recruitment powers (to enlist more heroes) and their fighting ability (to combat the villains who keep popping up to cause trouble). Players recruit heroes from an array of six cards, with empty slots refilled as needed. At the start of a player&#39;s turn, he reveals a villain and adds it to the row of villains. This row has a limited number of spaces, and if it fills up, the earliest villain to arrive escapes, possibly punishing the heroes in some way. Some villains also take an action when showing up for the first time, such as kidnapping an innocent bystander. The villain deck also contains &quot;master strike&quot; cards, and whenever one of these shows up, the mastermind villain (controlled by the game) takes a bonus action. As players fight and defeat villains, they collect those cards, which will be worth points at game&#39;s end. Players can also fight the mastermind; if a player has enough fighting power, he claims one of the attack cards beneath the mastermind, which has a particular effect on the game. If all of these cards are claimed, the game ends and players tally their points to see who wins. If the mastermind completes his scheme, however &ndash; having a certain number of villains escape, for example, or imposing a certain number of wounds on the heroes &ndash; then the players all lose. Players create their own powerful combos on the fly, combining their heroes awesome abilities to take down nasty Marvel supervillians like Venom and Mystique. Over the course of the game, recruit increasingly powerful Hero cards to add to your deck, building a stronger and stronger deck of the ultimate Marvel superhero combinations Innovative &quot;Mastermind&quot; mechanics allow the game itself to fight back again the players: If players aren&#39;t careful, villainous Marvel masterminds like Magneto, Loki and Dr Doom threaten to accomplish dark schemes and defeat all the players at once!

Can you expose and defeat the ruthless gunmen around you? Bang! The Dice Game keeps the core of the Bang! card game in place. At the start of the game, players each take a role card that secretly places them on a team: the Sheriff and deputies, outlaws, and renegades. The Sheriff and deputies need to kill the outlaws, the outlaws win by killing the Sheriff, and the renegades want to be the last players alive in the game. Each player also receives a character card which grants him a special power in the game. The Sheriff reveals his role card and takes the first turn of the game. On a turn, a player can roll the five dice up to three times, using the results of the dice to shoot neighboring players, increase the range of his shots, heal his (or anyone else&#39;s) life points, or put him in range of the Indians, which are represented by nine tokens in the center of the table. Each time a player rolls an arrow, he takes one of these tokens; when the final token is taken, each player loses one life point for each token he holds, then the tokens are returned to the center of the table. If a player collects a trio of Gatling symbols on the dice, he fires one shot at everyone else and rids himself of Indian tokens. Who&#39;ll get his shot off first?

The mechanics draw from classic games as well as newer, story-based games.&quot; - Jonathan Tweet, co-designer",https://t.cfjump.com/33917/p/33974628,http://www.ozgameshop.com/board-game-guides-and-books/13th-age-fantasy-rpg?utm_source=commission+factory&amp;utm_medium=shopping&amp;utm_campaign=commission+factory+shopping+data+feed+(17/05/2017),http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33974628.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33974628@50x50.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33974628@100x100.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33974628@120x120.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33974628@200x200.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33974628@300x300.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/33974628@400x400.jpg,72.49 AUD,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Banks of turbolasers unleash torrential volleys of fire against squadrons of X-wing and TIEs. Engineering teams race to route additional power to failing shields. Laser blasts and explosions flare across the battlefield. Even a single ship can change the tide of battle.&nbsp;In Star Wars: Armada, you assume the role of fleet admiral, serving with either the Imperial Navy or Rebel Alliance. You assemble your fleet and engage the enemy. Using the game&rsquo;s unique maneuver tool, you steer your capital ships across the battlefield, even while squadrons of starfighters buzz around them. Then, as these ships exchange fire, it&rsquo;s your job to issue the tactical commands that will decide the course of battle and, perhaps, the fate of the galaxy.&nbsp;Maneuver Tool The maneuver tool is one of the game&rsquo;s most innovative features and adds a unique feel to the way your capital ships must accommodate for inertia as they maneuver through the stars.&nbsp;It consists of a number of segments linked with hinges, which is used to plot the ship&#39;s course. More nimble ships are allowed to turn the ship further at each hinge.&nbsp;Command Stack Armada balances the awesome scale of the Star Wars galaxy&rsquo;s ships and space warfare with intuitive ship designs and accessible rules for issuing commands and resolving combat that make for rich, engaging, and highly tactical play experiences.&nbsp;Capital ships are extremely powerful war machines, but they&rsquo;re also massive and sophisticated vessels that can&rsquo;t swiftly react to every development in the heat of battle. Accordingly, the key to flying these vessels effectively is learning how to plan ahead. You want to issue your commands in such a way that your crews will be ready to execute them at just the right times.&nbsp;Each of your pre-painted capital ships has a command value, which determines how many commands it will have in its stack at any given point in time.

Once you have locked your selections, you place the commands in your stack in the order of your choice.

Each player takes on the role of one of the minor Condottiere princes, such as the Gonzagas or d&#39;Estes. Then there are the big five major cities: Venice, Milan, Florence, Rome, and Naples. These are not controlled by individual players, but players will gain &#39;interests&#39; in them as the game progresses. Each city has six tiles, most of which represent a famous character such as Lucrezia Borgia or Lorenzo Medici. Each tile has its own special properties that are linked to the character on the tile. Thus Cesare Borgia will help you to become more treacherous, while a Venetian merchant will increase your income. These tiles are also worth victory points, depending on the status of the city at the end of the game. A city&#39;s status will change as a result of war. When two cities fight, they will each need a Condottiere to fight for them. Players bid, using influence points, to decide who will represent each city. The outcome of the war will depend on a little luck and the size of each player&#39;s army. Each player also gets paid for fighting, no matter what the outcome of the war is. Thus players can turn influence into gold, which in turn can be used to buy more City tiles. No game on the Italian Renaissance would be complete without an element of treachery. Players can be openly treacherous by buying Treachery tiles, which will allow them to do nasty things like steal influence, bribe troops, or knock players out of an auction. However, the game allows players to be devious in other ways, that still remain legal. Making sure that a war goes the way you want it to is an important part of the game, and it is not always the player with the best army who ends up fighting. Want a city to lose, well become Condottiere for them and make sure you have a really bad army, or use Treachery tiles to bribe your own troops not to fight. At some point some player will become the Pope, which means he can form a Holy League (i.e. join one side in a battle). Want to make sure the Pope is on the &#39;right&#39; side, well why not bribe him? What players negotiate over is up to them. The game does not force negotiation and works perfectly well without it, but it remains an avenue for players to explore. 3 - 6 Players 180 Min Playing Time Age: 12",https://t.cfjump.com/33917/p/34000328,http://www.ozgameshop.com/party-and-family-board-games/princes-of-the-renaissance-board-game?utm_source=commission+factory&amp;utm_medium=shopping&amp;utm_campaign=commission+factory+shopping+data+feed+(17/05/2017),http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/34000328.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/34000328@50x50.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/34000328@100x100.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/34000328@120x120.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/34000328@200x200.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/34000328@300x300.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/34000328@400x400.jpg,95.99 AUD,Mercury Games,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Meanwhile, the princess is recruiting knights for her personal guard. While they are busy laboring their fields, farmers stumble upon magical portals that lead to unexplored areas, which are hopefully out of the dragon&lsquo;s reach.

In this fast-paced yet highly strategic game, 2 to 4 players take control of Viking clans, invading, pillaging and battling in a quest to gain as much glory as possible before Ragnarok finally consumes the land! Most player strategies are guided by the cards drafted at the beginning of each of the three game rounds (or Ages). These &quot;Gods Gifts&quot; grant your numerous boons for your clan including: increased Viking strength and devious battle strategies, upgrades to your clan or even the aid of legendary creatures from Norse mythology. They may also include various quests from dominating specific provinces to having lots of your vikings sent to Valhalla. Most of these cards are aligned with one of the Norse gods, hinting at the kind of strategy they support. For example, Thor gives more glory for victory in battle, Heimdall grants you foresight and surprises, Tyr strengthens you in battle while the trickster Loki actually rewards you for losing battles, or punishes the winner.&nbsp; Players 2-4 Playing Time 60-90 minutes Suggested ages 10+",https://t.cfjump.com/33917/p/34155558,http://www.ozgameshop.com/miniature-board-games/blood-rage?utm_source=commission+factory&amp;utm_medium=shopping&amp;utm_campaign=commission+factory+shopping+data+feed+(17/05/2017),http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/34155558.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/34155558@50x50.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/34155558@100x100.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/34155558@120x120.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/34155558@200x200.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/34155558@300x300.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/34155558@400x400.jpg,92.99 AUD,COOL MINI OR NOT INC,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The majority of people just get on with their lives, accepting their monstrous rulers. However, a growing band of revolutionaries wish to free mankind from their slavery. These freedom fighters call themselves the Restorationists. A secret war has already broken out between the Restorationists and the forces loyal to the Old Ones. The invention of dynamite has changed the balance of power, and a lone assassin now has the capacity to destroy an Old One. In this shadow world of assassins, informers, police agents and anarchists, nobody is quite sure who is who and which side they fight for.&nbsp;The game A Study in Emerald draws its central plot from the award-winning short story penned by Neil Gaiman, in which the worlds of Sherlock Holmes and H.P. Lovecraft are combined to telling effect. However, to create a world detailed enough for players, much has been added from real history. The nineteenth century was a time of unrest, with many colorful characters fighting both for and against the authorities. A Study in Emerald is the outcome of the merging of these three worlds.&nbsp;This second edition of A Study in Emerald sports new artwork by Ian O&#39;Toole and Tatiana Kuzilova along with a streamlined set of rules that will hopefully help those folks who found the first version a tad complicated.

Experience the Galactic Civil War like never before. In Rebellion, you control the entire Galactic Empire or the fledgling Rebel Alliance. You must command starships, account for troop movements, and rally systems to your cause. Given the differences between the Empire and Rebel Alliance, each side has different win conditions, and you&#39;ll need to adjust your play style depending on who you represent: As the Imperial player, you can command legions of Stormtroopers, swarms of TIEs, Star Destroyers, and even the Death Star. You rule the galaxy by fear, relying on the power of your massive military to enforce your will. To win the game, you need to snuff out the budding Rebel Alliance by finding its base and obliterating it. Along the way, you can subjugate worlds or even destroy them. &nbsp; As the Rebel player, you can command dozens of troopers, T-47 airspeeders, Corellian corvettes, and fighter squadrons. However, these forces are no match for the Imperial military. In terms of raw strength, you&#39;ll find yourself clearly overmatched from the very outset, so you&#39;ll need to rally the planets to join your cause and execute targeted military strikes to sabotage Imperial build yards and steal valuable intelligence. To win the Galactic Civil War, you&#39;ll need to sway the galaxy&#39;s citizens to your cause. If you survive long enough and strengthen your reputation, you inspire the galaxy to a full-scale revolt, and you win. Featuring more than 150 plastic miniatures and two game boards that account for thirty-two of the Star Wars galaxy&#39;s most notable systems, Rebellion features a scope that is as large and sweeping as any Star Wars game before it. Yet for all its grandiosity, Rebellion remains intensely personal, cinematic, and heroic. As much as your success depends upon the strength of your starships, vehicles, and troops, it depends upon the individual efforts of such notable characters as Leia Organa, Mon Mothma, Grand Moff Tarkin, and Emperor Palpatine. As civil war spreads throughout the galaxy, these leaders are invaluable to your efforts, and the secret missions they attempt will evoke many of the most inspiring moments from the classic trilogy.

In more detail, players select various polyomino tiles of flower beds from a central market grid, depending on the location of the &quot;gardener&quot;, then place them on one of their two personal garden boards. Each board has several garden elements that are worth points when not planted over, and these are scored on two different tracks as soon as a garden has been finished.

Those ships drilled, mined and transported raw minerals from faraway planetary systems back to Earth. Soon hundreds upon hundreds of star systems were visited and their planets were drilled down to their cores and stripped of valuable resources. After the ships moved on to the next system, the leftover excavation installations still lingered as a grim sign of past mining operations. In no time, two corporations monopolized the galaxy mining business, but with myriad systems to exploit they remained in a state of uneasy peace &mdash; a peace about to be broken due to an automated analysis of reports from a system mined many decades ago that yielded something weird, that led to a discovery of...Metallum. This new substance, which seems to carry a promise for interstellar travel for living organisms, is bound to stir conflict. The Earth Government immediately steps in and claims ownership of the system in the name of the &quot;good of mankind&quot;, but it&#39;s clear that one of the two corporations will be afforded the exclusive rights to extract Metallum &ndash; and the huge profits that come with it. The tension raises instantly. Outright corporate war is avoided only thanks to a promise to grant the mining rights to the corporation that will develop more efficient mining infrastructure on the planets. Incidents are bound to happen with old installations used to destroy enemy Extractors since it&#39;s clear that the Earth Government will be handing their grants based on Metallum extraction rates of each corporation before finally awarding exclusive mining rights to one of them. The best pilots from each corporation sit down behind their consoles as their factory ships approach the system with production of Extractors set to maximum. Metallum is a strategy game for two players who take on roles of corporate pilots charged with the task of directing their factory ships in order to construct a more efficient mining network on the system&#39;s planets than their opponent does. Each round consists of three main phases: Programming: Players simultaneously create a program by composing puzzle-like subroutines that activate various systems on the factory ship (engines for moving, production for deploying Extractors, etc.). Some of the more powerful subroutines take more time to execute and hence impede your ability to react to the other player&#39;s moves &mdash; and they might even prevent you from activating other ship systems. Action: Players execute programs composed during the programming phase. Since the order of execution of subroutines is decided by the player, the same program can yield vastly different outcomes, which leads to many interesting tactical decisions. During this phase new Extractors are also deployed on the system&#39;s planets. Profits: Players earn credits for the planets on which they have their Extractors depending on who has more of them. After nine rounds, the pilot who&#39;s earned the most credits for his corporation is declared the winner. Will you be able to cover the planets of the system with a network of your Extractors and at the same time disturb the plans of your opponent? Although the conflict is officially only an economic one, the successful pilot needs to know when to strike at a rival&#39;s mining infrastructure or make &quot;slight modification&quot; to it. When all is said and done, nobody will remember the details of the struggle &mdash; only the name of the greatest pilot in the history of the galaxy. 2 Players 60 Min Playing Time Age: 10",https://t.cfjump.com/33917/p/34155573,http://www.ozgameshop.com/strategy-board-games/metallum-strategy-game?utm_source=commission+factory&amp;utm_medium=shopping&amp;utm_campaign=commission+factory+shopping+data+feed+(17/05/2017),http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/34155573.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/34155573@50x50.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/34155573@100x100.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/34155573@120x120.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/34155573@200x200.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/34155573@300x300.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/34155573@400x400.jpg,50.99 AUD,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Each player becomes a master thief about to commit the most daring burglary of his career. During the game players may use unique abilities of their thieves as well as various action cards, which represent maneuvers, alchemical potions or complicated devices inspired by visionary ideas of Renaissance inventors. The players choose cards to play and then use available Action Points to plan the order of their activities. This makes the game very dynamic, with each resolved action dramatically influencing the turn. The players&rsquo; order changes dynamically depending on the number of Action Points placed on each chosen card. The goal of the game is to break into the vault inside the Emperor&#39;s palace and steal the Emperors&#39; Jewel, the symbol of power very precious to the ruling dynasty. However, this is hardly the end, because thieves must escape from the city with their loot. This is no easy task - the streets are patrolled by vigilant city guards and veteran captains well versed in all criminal tricks. Additionally, time is running fast for the thieves - event cards introduced each turn control the flow of the game, escalating its pace and difficulty of challenges for the players to overcome. The thief who will manage to escape through one of four city gates taking with him the Emperors&rsquo; Jewel or other valuable loot will be the winner of the game. Anyone who will stay inside Hadria after resolving the last event card will be caught and mercilessly thrown inside the city dungeon, their names erased from the annals of the omnipotent Guild. 2 - 4 Players 60&ndash;120 Min Playing Time Age: 14",https://t.cfjump.com/33917/p/34155575,http://www.ozgameshop.com/strategy-board-games/age-of-thieves-board-game?utm_source=commission+factory&amp;utm_medium=shopping&amp;utm_campaign=commission+factory+shopping+data+feed+(17/05/2017),http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/34155575.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/34155575@50x50.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/34155575@100x100.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/34155575@120x120.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/34155575@200x200.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/34155575@300x300.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/34155575@400x400.jpg,95.49 AUD,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

With elegantly simple gameplay, Ticket to Ride can be learned in under 15 minutes, while providing players with intense strategic and tactical decisions every turn. Make your way across 1900s America Ticket to Ride is a cross-country train adventure. Players compete to connect different cities by laying claim to railway routes on a map of 20th century North America, visiting great cities and collecting points along the way. On each turn, players can collect cards of various types of train cars, purchase Destination Tickets or claim routes with pre-owned train cards. The longer the route that has claimed, the more points they earn. Additional points are also added to those who fulfil Destination Tickets &ndash; goal cards that connect distant cities as well as to the one player who builds the longest continuous route. Inspired from a literature classic Paying tribute to Phileas Fogg&rsquo;s expedition around the world, Ticket to Ride sets out to out to create the perfect setting for an impossible journey in a winner-takes-all competition. The objective: Who can travel by rail to the most cities in North America &mdash; in just 7 days. The journey begins immediately&hellip; Great quality pieces Ticket to Ride features high-quality illustrations and components including: an oversize board map of North America, 225 custom train cars, over 100 illustrated train cards, and wooden scoring markers as well as 30 destination tickets Simple Rules The rules are simple enough to write on a train ticket &ndash; each turn you either draw more cards, claim a route, or get additional Destination Tickets, says Ticket to Ride designer, Alan R.

How easy is it when an opponent&#39;s Alien-Ninja decides to Beam Up your minions to other Bases - flat out Assassinate them? What about when the Pirate-Dinosaur player Full Sails in and releases King Rex to stomp your minions into the ground, or when the Wizard-Zombies use their Mystic Power to create an Outbreak, suddenly flooding minions onto the Base from the discard pile? Or what if you faced a Zombie-Dinosaur player instead and he created an Outbreak of massive beasts all at once?!? When a Base is smashed, each player in first, second and third place scores points. Fourth place? Sorry, bro &ndash; try harder next time . With eight different factions, Smash Up includes dozens of combinations to try. Pirate-Aliens play different than Ninja-Aliens, for instance.

The basics of TtR gameplay remain the same as always &mdash; players collect train cards in order to claim routes between pairs of cities with the overall goal of completing tickets they hold in hand &mdash; but Ticket to Ride: Nederland twists this gameplay in two ways. First, nearly every route on the game board is a double-route, with two tracks connecting cities. Both of these routes are in play no matter how many players are in the game. Second, every route &mdash; whether double or single &mdash; has a bridge toll that a player must pay when building on that route. On a single route or the first track of a double route, the player pays this toll &mdash; which costs 1-4 coins &mdash; to the bank; on the second track of a double route, the player pays this toll to the player who built the first track. Players start the game with 30 coins, and if you can&#39;t pay a toll, you must take a loan card to cover the fare, with each loan costing you 5 points at the end of the game. In addition to helping you avoid loans, coins matter because at game&#39;s end, players receive a bonus based on how many coins they hold relative to everyone else. In a five-player game, for example, the player with the most coins scores a 55 point bonus; the 2nd place player scores 35 points, and the other players 20, 10 and 0 points. If you&#39;ve taken a loan, however, you&#39;re ineligible for this bonus scoring, so players have an incentive to build early and often. These coin bonuses are balanced by the multitude of destination tickets with large point values: six of them are worth 29 points while another seventeen are worth 17-26 points.

A player can take a card only if it&#39;s not covered by any others, so timing comes into play as well as bonus moves that allow you to take a second card immediately. As in the original game, each card that you acquire can be built, discarded for three coins, or used to construct a wonder.&nbsp;Each player starts with four wonder cards, and the construction of a wonder provides its owner with a special ability. Only seven wonders can be built, though, so one player will end up short.&nbsp;Players can purchase resources at any time from the bank, or they can gain cards during the game that provide them with resources for future building; as you acquire resources, the cost for those particular resources increases for your opponent, representing your dominance in this area.&nbsp;A player can win 7 Wonders: Duel in one of three ways. Each time that you acquire a military card, you advance the military marker toward your opponent&#39;s capital, giving you a bonus at certain positions. If you reach the opponent&#39;s capital, you win the game immediately. Similarly, if you acquire any six of seven different scientific symbols, you achieve scientific dominance and win immediately. If neither of these situations occurs, then the player with the most points at the end of the game wins.

For example, the Storm Giants seek to restore their lost monarch, King Hekaton. The Cloud Giants seek an ancient dragon treasure trove, and the Hill Giants seek an abundance of food with which to feed their massive monarch, Chief Guh. In Assault of the Giants players send their giants out to wage war on each other and the small folk, but the game&rsquo;s real strategy lies in each player&rsquo;s ability to pursue their giant race&rsquo;s unique agenda, not only through combat but also through clever cardplay.

After three ages of play, whoever has collected the most glory wins! In more detail, the land of Ethnos contains twelve tribes of fantasy creatures, and in each game you choose six of them (five in a 2/3-player game), then create a deck with only the creatures in those tribes. The cards come in six colors, which match the six regions of Ethnos. Place three glory tokens in each region, arranging them from low to high. Each player starts the game with one card in hand, then 4-12 cards are placed face up on the table. On a turn, a player either recruits an ally or plays a band of allies. In the former case, you take a face-up card (without replacing it from the deck) or the top card of the deck and add it to your hand. In the latter case, you choose a set of cards in your hand that match either in tribe or in color, play them in front of you on the table, then discard all other cards in hand. You then place one or more tokens in the region that matches the color of the top card just played, and you use the power of the tribe member on the top card just played. At the end of the first age, whoever has the most tokens in a region scores the glory shown on the first token. After the second age, the players with the most and secondmost tokens score glory equal to the values shown on the first and second tokens. Players score again after the third age, then whoever has the most glory wins.

Gather your crews and set sail for adventure on the high seas in Rum &amp; Bones: Second Tide! Based on online MOBA (Multiplayer Online Battle Arena) style games, Rum &amp; Bones has 2-6 players taking control of legendary pirate heroes, each with unique powers and abilities, as their crews fight over Davy Jones&#39; legendary treasure! Players each control up to five heroes at any time, moving them across the game board in an attempt to destroy various key features on their opponents&#39; ship. Victory is obtained by destroying enough of these features. Your heroes are not alone, however, as your crew also consists of deckhands and bosuns who, while not controlled by the player, will work on a simple AI to wreak havoc on the enemy! Of course, what would pirates be without plunder? And in Rum &amp; Bones the most sought after treasure are Davy Jones&#39; mythical pieces of eight! Players amass these powerful coins during gameplay to unleash devastating abilities and attacks from their Heroes, crushing all enemies before them until only they remain! This game is both a stand-alone and compatible as an expansion to Rum &amp; Bones. In Rum &amp; Bones: Second Tide, 2 to 6 players will take control of one of two deadly pirate crews: The mysterious and monstrous Deep Lords, who seek to claim Davy Jones&rsquo; treasure in an effort to flood the world and reshape it to their liking, or the Marea de la Muerte&cedil; a crew of ruthless gold-seeking Spanish cutthroats who will stop at nothing to claim the treasure for their own greed! Players control teams of three to five heroes, depending on the number of players, each with various and unique powers and abilities. These Heroes are drawn from five different classes, each with their own strengths and weaknesses: Captains: Jack-of-all-Trade Heroes who specialize in buffing other Heroes. Brutes: The toughest of the tough, Brutes can take a ton of punishment and only get stronger for doing so! Gunner: Ranged damage dealers, Gunners have the lowest HP of all classes, but can also dish out the most hurt. Swashbucklers: Like Gunners, Swashbucklers specialize in dealing damage, but prefer the up-close-and-personal approach. Quartermaster: While they don&#39;t deal the most damage, Quartermasters make up for it in raw utility: specializing in healing and buffing Heroes, and also enhancing your Deckhands and Bosuns! The most notable change to gameplay is their new &quot;dynamic Leveling System&quot;. Now each Hero begins the game with their Basic Attack skill card. As they gain Coins, which are obtained from KO&#39;ing enemies and Objectives, they can use those Coins to buy new skills, as well as level up existing skills! Also, they&#39;ve introduced a new &quot;Alternating Activation&quot; method of play where players will take turns activating 1 Hero (or their Crew), and then their opponent will do the same, continuing back and forth until everyone has gone.

At the beginning of the game, however, players don&#39;t know which mission they must fulfill! In the standard four-player game, each player guides one of four secret agents. The four characters are allied in pairs: Lord Fiddlebottom and Colonel Bubble are always partnered against Agent X and Madame Zsa Zsa. Each of the four agents is represented by one of four different figures, with different builds: tall, short, fat, thin. Only one of them represents the actual character controlled by a player. The other three figures represent spies which are friendly to him and that are trying to confuse the opposition. On a turn, a player shakes the Phantom of Prophecy randomizer to determine his three available actions, e.g., moving on a land route or a sea route. The player moves his figures, trying to reach spaces already occupied by the other players&#39; figures or the Ambassador. When figures are in the same space, the current player gets the right to &quot;ask questions&quot; and inspect some of the cards of that player. By deduction and a logical process of elimination, he can draw conclusions as to the identity and intentions of the other players. The first goal of every agent is to discover which of the other players is his partner. This partner has the other half of the &quot;code&quot; indicating his secret mission. After discovering (or thinking he has discovered) the real identity of the other players, an agent must trade his secret mission card with his ally. This will reveal the final mission and what must be done to complete it. If either agent on a team completes the mission, both he and his partner win the game. There is another character with an important role in the game: the Ambassador. He can be used to get clearer information about the other characters. Everyone wants to meet him because he is well-informed and can be useful to accomplish your purposes, but he can also help your rivals, so do everything you can to keep him far from them. The 2013 version of Inkognito from Ares Games raises the maximum player count to five by allowing someone to play the Ambassador and move it during his turn. He can still gather clues when the other players question the Ambassador during their turn, and the other players can still gather clues from him. The goal of the Ambassador&#39;s player is to know everything about the other characters, guessing their identities and builds. If the Ambassador achieves &quot;perfect knowledge&quot; before a team accomplishes its secret missions, he wins the game.",https://t.cfjump.com/33917/p/34481735,http://www.ozgameshop.com/strategy-board-games/inkognito-board-game?utm_source=commission+factory&amp;utm_medium=shopping&amp;utm_campaign=commission+factory+shopping+data+feed+(17/05/2017),http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/34481735.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/34481735@50x50.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/34481735@100x100.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/34481735@120x120.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/34481735@200x200.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/34481735@300x300.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/34481735@400x400.jpg,71.49 AUD,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The object of Power Grid is to supply the mostcities with power when someone&rsquo;s network gains a predetermined size.

Game play in Dixit Odssey matches that of Dixit: Each turn one player is the storyteller. This player secretly chooses one card in his hand then gives a word or sentence to describe this card - but no too obviously. Each other player chooses a card in hand that matches this word/sentence and gives it to the storyteller. The storyteller then lays out the cards and all other players vote on which card belongs to the storyteller. If no one or everyone guesses the storyteller&#39;s card, the storyteller receives no points and all players receieve two; otherwise the storyteller and the correct guesser(s) each receive three points. Players score one point for each vote their image receives. Players refill their hands and the next player becomes the storyteller. When the deck runs out the player with the most points wins. The fantastic universe of Dixit, winner of the Spiel des Jahres 2010, returns to entrance you once more. With Dixit Odyssey, continue the adventure in new worlds that will enchant and delight. Dixit Odyssey gives players the chance to choose the whimsical and dreamlike art that matches the storyteller&rsquo;s tale, and then see if they can find the storyteller&rsquo;s card among all those before them. Using your imagination and wit, journey through wild and magical new worlds and rediscover the brilliance and wonder of the original.

This is similar to Carcassonne but with Roads replaced with Trading Routes and claimed by Merchants instead of Robbers, Cities replaced with Asteroid Fields and claimed by Explorers instead of Knights and Cloisters replaced with Planets and claimed by Conquerers instead of Monks. There is no farming equivalent. Faction symbols (Empire, Rebel Alliance and Bounty Hunters) provide scoring bonuses regardless of what faction your Meeples belong to. Majority control is determined by dice rolling with the highest result rather than the sum determining the winner, although tiebreaks and defeats still provide some points. A player receives dice equal to the number of his Meeples involved in the majority control plus additional ones for using his large Meeple and any matching Faction symbols but this is always capped at three dice. One notable change is that Planets can be conquered by placing tiles adjacent to the Planet tile where the player now has the option of placing a Meeple on the adjacent Planet tile instead of on the tile he placed. There is also a four player team variant where it is the two Empire colours (black/Darth Vader and white/Storm Troopers) versus the two Rebel Alliance colours (red/Luke Skywalker and green/Yoda).

Players compete to lure and destroy hapless adventurers, racing to outbid one another to see who can build the most enticing, treasure-filled dungeon. The goal of Boss Monster is to be the first Boss to amass ten Souls, which are gained when a Hero is lured and defeated &mdash; but a player can lose if his Boss takes five Wounds from Heroes who survive his dungeon. Playing Boss Monster requires you to juggle two competing priorities: the need to lure Heroes at a faster rate than your opponents, and the need to kill those Heroes before they reach your Boss. Players can build one room per turn, each with its own damage and treasure value. More attractive rooms tend to deal less damage, so a Boss who is too greedy can become inundated with deadly Heroes. Players interact with each other by building rooms and playing Spells. Because different Heroes seek different treasure types, and rooms are built simultaneously (played face down, then revealed), this means that every &quot;build phase&quot; is a bidding war. Spells are instant-speed effects that can give players advantages or disrupt opponents. As a standalone card game with 150 cards, Boss Monster contains everything that 2-4 players need to play.

In every game, you and your opponent match wits and resources over key events. If you can thwart your opponent, you claim the event, bringing you closer to victory. Whether you seek to triumph through military might, or use diplomacy to achieve your ends, the fate of the galaxy rests in your hands. &nbsp; On one side of this galactic battleground are the heroes of the Rebel Alliance. Only rarely can these heroes go toe to toe with the unlimited reserves of the Imperial Navy and Army. Instead, the iconic characters of Star Wars and the unsung heroes of the Rebellion must work in secret, utilizing diplomacy, reconnaissance, and the Force to achieve their aims. Even when the Rebellion deploys its full military strength to win a battle or destroy a key Imperial emplacement, they need the groundwork put in place by Alliance Special Forces. &nbsp; Opposing the heroic endeavors of the Rebel Alliance is the massive power of the Empire, led by the twisted Emperor. The dark side of the Force is strong with the Emperor and Darth Vader, and the military might of the Empire is unparalleled across the galaxy. Whether you undertake aggressive negotiations or hire bounty hunters and scum to ferret out Rebel spies, making the Empire the ultimate power in the galaxy rests in your hands. &nbsp; To successfully win these struggles and reclaim the galaxy in Star Wars: Empire vs. Rebellion, you will need to utilize all of your resources. Every turn, you can increase your faction&rsquo;s presence at the current event by drawing the top card from your deck and putting it into play. Each resource card you play give you more power and brings you closer to the objective value of the current event. As an example, the resource card shown to the right has a resource value of five, which it contributes to your total resource value while in play. Playing more resource cards may bring you closer to your target, but it also makes your efforts more obvious. If your total resource value ever passes the event&rsquo;s objective value, your forces are discovered and your opponent claims the event. &nbsp; Instead of playing a new resource card, you can also trigger the power of a resource card currently in play, exercising the might of the Empire or the cunning of the Rebel Alliance. To activate a resource card&rsquo;s power, you must exhaust it by rotating it 90 degrees clockwise. Once a card is exhausted, you can&#39;t use its power unless it becomes ready again. In addition, an exhausted card contributes its exhausted resource value, shown in the lower left-hand corner of the card while the resource is ready.",https://t.cfjump.com/33917/p/34481836,http://www.ozgameshop.com/strategy-card-games/star-wars-empire-vs-rebellion?utm_source=commission+factory&amp;utm_medium=shopping&amp;utm_campaign=commission+factory+shopping+data+feed+(17/05/2017),http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/34481836.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/34481836@50x50.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/34481836@100x100.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/34481836@120x120.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/34481836@200x200.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/34481836@300x300.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/34481836@400x400.jpg,18.99 AUD,Edge Entertainment,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In Winter Tales, a storytelling board game, players tell the tale of the conflict between the characters of fairy tales, who represent all that is good and hopeful, and the Soldiers of Winter, who incarnate evil and the fierce cold of Winter. Players will ally themselves with one of the warring Factions, controlling characters and fighting for the comeback of Spring or the suffocation of all hope, bringing on an endless Winter. Winter Tales is an ever-changing game as each time the players will tell a completely different story, creating a shared plot.

The Duke is a dynamic, tile-based strategy game with an old-world, feudal theme, high-quality wooden playing pieces, and an innovative game mechanism in its double-sided tiles. Each side represents a different posture &ndash; often considered to be defensive or offensive &ndash; and demonstrates exactly what the piece can do within the turn. At the end of a move (or after the use of a special ability), the tile is flipped to its other side, displaying a new offensive or defensive posture. Each posture conveys different options for maneuver and attack. The full circle is a standard Move, the hollow circle the Jump, the arrow provides for the Slide, the star a special Strike ability and so on. Each turn a player may select any tile to maneuver, attempting to defend his own troops while positioning himself to capture his opponent&#39;s tiles. If you end your movement in a square occupied by an opponent&#39;s tile, you capture that tile. Capture your opponent&#39;s Duke to win! Players start the game by placing their Duke in one of the two middle squares on their side of the game board. Two Footman are then placed next to the Duke. Each turn a player may choose to either move a single tile or randomly draw a new tile from the bag. With twelve different Troop Tiles, all double-sided, and sixteen total pieces for each player, the variety of game play is limitless. Beyond the endless variety of the basic game, Terrain Tiles introduce a variety of game play options, altering the game board.

Crossroads is a new series from Plaid Hat Games that tests a group of survivors ability to work together and stay alive while facing crises and challenges from both outside and inside. Dead Of Winter is the first game in this series, designed by Isaac Vega and Jon Gilmour. It puts 2-5 players together in a small, weakened colony of survivors in a world where most of humanity are either dead or diseased, flesh-craving monsters. Each player leads a faction of survivors with dozens of different characters in the game. Dead of Winter is a meta-cooperative psychological survival game. This means the players are working together toward one common victory condition but for each individual player to achieve victory they must also complete their personal secret objective. This secret objective could relate to a psychological tick that&#39;s fairly harmless to most others in the colony, a dangerous obsession that could put the main objective at risk, a desire for sabotage of the main mission or worst of all vengeance against the colony! Certain games could end with all players winning, some winning and some losing or all players losing. Work toward the group&#39;s goal but don&#39;t get walked all over by a loud-mouth who&#39;s only looking out for their own interests.&nbsp; Dead of Winter is an experience that can only be accomplished through the medium of tabletop games. It is a story-centric game about surviving through a harsh winter in an apocalyptic world. The survivors are all dealing with their own psychological imperatives but must still find a way to work together to fight off outside threats, resolve crises, find food and supplies and keep the colony&#39;s morale up. Dead of Winter has players making frequent, difficult, heavily-thematic, wildly-varying decisions, that often have them deciding between what is best for the colony and what is best for themselves.

Depending upon his office and the various cards he holds, each player has a certain number of votes.

El Presidente draws cards face down from the money deck (which varies in denomination from $1 to $3) and must propose a budget for the year, distributing the money as he sees fit amongst the various offices. Of course, loyalty to him is usually rewarded, while those pesky &quot;thorns in his side&quot; are usually cut off completely. The beauty of all this, though, is that El Presidente can &mdash; and most always does &mdash; keep some of the loot for himself.

Suspicion is always keen.&nbsp;Players may attempt to assassinate the other players by guessing where they will be from among five locations.

To start play, lay out all of the patches at random in a circle and place a marker directly counter-clockwise of the 2-1 patch. Each player takes five buttons &mdash; the currency/points in the game &mdash; and someone is chosen as the start player. On a turn, a player either purchases one of the three patches standing clockwise of the spool or passes. To purchase a patch, you pay the cost in buttons shown on the patch, advance your time token on the time track a number of spaces equal to the time shown on the patch, move the spool to that patch&#39;s location in the circle, then add the patch to your game board. You&#39;re free to place the patch anywhere on your board that doesn&#39;t overlap other patches, but you probably want to fit things together as tightly as possible. If your time token is behind or on top of the other player&#39;s time token, then you take another turn; otherwise the opponent now goes. Instead of purchasing a patch, you can choose to pass; to do this, you move your time token to the space immediately in front of the opponent&#39;s time token, then take one button from the bank for each space you moved. In addition to a button cost and time cost, each patch also features 0-3 buttons, and when you move your time token past a button on the time track, you sum the number of buttons on your game board, then take this many buttons from the bank. What&#39;s more, the time track depicts five 1x1 patches on it, and during set-up you place five actual 1x1 patches on these spaces. Whoever first passes a patch on the time track claims this patch and immediately places it on his game board. When a player takes an action that moves his time token to the central square of the time track, he places the purchased patch (assuming he had purchased one and wasn&#39;t passing), then takes one final button scoring from the bank. Once both players are in the center, each player loses two buttons for each blank square on his game board. Whoever has the most buttons wins.",https://t.cfjump.com/33917/p/34771491,http://www.ozgameshop.com/strategy-board-games/patchwork-board-game?utm_source=commission+factory&amp;utm_medium=shopping&amp;utm_campaign=commission+factory+shopping+data+feed+(17/05/2017),http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/34771491.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/34771491@50x50.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/34771491@100x100.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/34771491@120x120.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/34771491@200x200.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/34771491@300x300.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/34771491@400x400.jpg,39.99 AUD,Mayfair Games,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Necromancer,Toys &amp; Games &gt; Games &gt; Card Games,"Mage Wars: Druid vs. Necromancer is a two-mage expansion set for Mage Wars, focusing on two schools of magic not emphasized in the core set. The Druid is schooled in Nature magic and is the undisputed master of plants. She also favors the Water school, using it to heal, restore, and grow her plants, as well as fight her enemies with geyser like blasts of water or downpours of acid rain. She does not use traditional spawnpoints; instead, her plants can spontaneously grow quickly across the arena. She has a theme of slow, steady growth, that accelerates her power quickly. She is the perfect Mage to use against a turtler because you cannot leave her alone to grow unchecked for too long. The Necromancer is a dark, sinister Mage who dabbles in the darkest of the black arts. His primary strengths lie in the summoning of the undead. His Graveyard spawnpoint summons armies of skeletons, zombies, and ghouls to do his bidding. His theme is a relentless assault. His skeletons are fragile, but keep reassembling themselves from a pile of bones to attack again! Zombies are slow, but very difficult to &quot;kill&quot;. Both of these creatures just keep coming!

It has diplomatic, economic, technological and military components, and can be won by gaining economic hegemony or technological supremacy (A-bomb), or by vanquishing a rival militarily. The 22 x 34 area map covers Eurasia to India and the Urals, plus the Americas. Military units are 5/8&quot; blocks, of 7 types (Infantry/Tank/Fortress/AirForce/Carrier/Fleet/Submarine), in 7 different colors (Germany/Italy/Russia/Britain/France/USA/Neutral). The mix of over 200 blocks allows great flexibility of force composition. There is a 55-card Action deck and a 55-card Investment deck, plus 30 Peace Dividend chits and 110 markers of various types. The game starts in 1936, with all 3 Great Powers virtually disarmed: Germany has repudiated the Versailles Peace Treaty, initiating an arms race in Europe. With blocks, the nature of military buildups remain unknown to rivals unless/until military conflict breaks out. The game may end peacefully or there may be war. There are game sanctions for attacking neutral minors or declaring war on an opponent, and rewards for remaining peaceful (you get a Peace Dividend chit of value 0-2 for every year you remain at Peace). You can win peacefully by: &bull; Economic Hegemony (total of Production secret Peace Dividend values is the greatest in 1945, or reaches 25 at any time) OR &bull; Technological Supremacy (build the A-bomb which takes 4 stages). If there is war, you can still win by either of the above methods, or by: &bull; Military Victory (capture of TWO enemy capitals each Great Power has 2). Economic production underlies all forms of power in the game. Production is the LEAST of controlled Population (cities), controlled Resources, and Industry (which starts low and can be built up with Investment cards), except that Resources can be ignored if at Peace. Powers can spend their current economic Production on either: &bull; Military units (new 1-step units or additional steps on existing units), OR &bull; Action cards, which have Diplomatic values (to gain Population and Resources without conflict) and a Command value (to move military units), OR &bull; Investment cards, which have Technological values (to enhance unit abilities) and a Factory value (the only way to increase Industry levels). Building a unit step or buying a card costs 1 Production. Simple. You can&rsquo;t inspect cards bought until after you have spent all Production. Initially, the Axis economy is Population/Resource limited, but ahead in [war] Industry, while the West and Russia are Industry-limited, with adequate empires of Population and Resources. Throttling/limiting rival economies by denial of Population/Resources is a key form of competition. In peacetime, this is primarily done via Diplomacy, committing Action cards to gain control minor nations and their Population/Resources, or to deny or reduce Rival control of them. At war, this can be done more directly by military conquest on land, by Naval/Submarine blockade of trade routes at sea, and by Strategic Bombing of enemy Industry by air forces. The early phase of the game tends to revolve around: &bull; Diplomatic infighting (using Action cards), to gain minor nations (Czech, Rumania, etc) for their Population and Resources, and &bull; Industrial buildup (via Investment cards), with &bull; Military buildups (with the nature of forces being built being unknown to opponents), &bull; Technology advancement (also via Investment cards), and some &bull; Military operations (using Action cards for Command), which can include Violating (attacking) neutral minors to gain Population/Resources when Diplomacy fails. If the game continues peacefully due to imposing defenses or player inclination, pressure builds as players approach a Production of 20, as secret Peace Dividend chits may take someone over the 25 Victory threshold. Or players may succeed in developing the Atomic Bomb and steal a victory that way. At some point, however, one Power (seeing opportunity or necessity) may Declare War on another. The victim gets immediate economic benefits in reaction, but military reality comes to the forefront from this point onward. The third party may well continue its economic development in peace. Or not. Unit movement is by Command card, which specifies a Command Priority letter that determines order of movement/combat and a Command Value number that determines the maximum number of units that can be moved. Command cards are only valid during one specified Season (Spring/Summer/Fall), so a variety of Command cards in one&rsquo;s hand is necessary for a Power to be able to move in every Season. But HandSizes are limited, so each player must balance competing demands for card resources with military security. Combat occurs when rival units occupy the same area, and is executed by units firing in order by Type (defenders firing first amongst equal types), rolling dice for hits. Units have different Firepowers (hit values) depending on the Class of unit they are targeting (ground, naval, air, sub). Land combat is one round per Season while sea battles are fought to a conclusion. Ground units without a Supply line lose 1 step per Season and cannot build (except Fortress units which are immune to both effects but cannot move). Triumph &amp; Tragedy is a true three-sided game: there is no requirement that the West and Russia be on the same side (and in fact there are valid reasons to attack each each other), and only ONE player can win the game. Table talk is allowed (and encouraged) but agreements are not enforceable. Alliances are shifting and cooperation is undependable. The game can continue as an economic battle of attrition or a sudden military explosion can change everything.

They must build a productive economy. And all the while, they must amaze the world with their great achievements to build up their heritage as the greatest nations in the history of mankind! Nations is an intense historical board game for 1-5 players that takes 40 minutes per player to play. Players control the fate of nations from their humble start in prehistoric times until the beginning of World War I. The nations constantly compete against each other and must balance immediate needs, long-term growth, threats, and opportunities. Gameplay introduction Players choose a Nation and a difficulty to play at, similar to the Civilization computer games series. After the growth phase 2 historical events are revealed, which the players will compete for during the round. Then players take a single small action each, in player order, as many times as they wish until all have passed. Actions are: &nbsp; Buy a card Deploy a worker Hire an architect for a wonder Special action provided by a card Players each have individual boards that represent their Nation. There are many ways that players affect, compete and indirectly interact with other players. But there is no map, no units to move around, no direct attacks on other players. When all have passed there is production, new player order is determined (every position is competed for), the historical events happen and if this is the last round of an age the books are scored.

In Quartermaster General: 1914, each card has two different uses: one when played, and another when prepared. On your turn, you have the opportunity to both play and prepare a card. You can also spend cards to draft more troops, or use cards to attrition your opponents. However, your deck represents your overall resources, so moving too quickly through your deck early might result in your unsupported armies being swept away in the final rounds of the game. This is worth it if you can capture Berlin or Paris in 1915, but if your gambit fails, you may have a tough road ahead. The game ends after 17 rounds of play, or earlier if one side has a commanding lead. 2-5 Players 90-120 Min Playing Time Age: 12",https://t.cfjump.com/33917/p/34995775,http://www.ozgameshop.com/war-board-games/quartermaster-general-1914-board-game?utm_source=commission+factory&amp;utm_medium=shopping&amp;utm_campaign=commission+factory+shopping+data+feed+(17/05/2017),http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/34995775.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/34995775@50x50.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/34995775@100x100.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/34995775@120x120.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/34995775@200x200.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/34995775@300x300.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/34995775@400x400.jpg,80.49 AUD,PSC Games,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

During your turn, you roll the dice and place temporary markers onto the board.

Wu-Feng now chooses where the incoming ghosts will be placed on the individual monk boards. Instead of placing the ghost on the board, Wu-Feng can use that ghost to power colored spells matching the color of the ghost or to bring new figures in play that scour the catacombs underneath the village; these figures are searching for the remains of Wu-Feng by digging in the dirt located there, and should they find the three icons required, the shadow of Wu-Feng descends on the village to fight directly with the monks.&nbsp;To aid the monks in their fight against this more devious incarnation of Wu-Feng, they have access to blood mantras, special abilities that come in different levels to adjust for the difficulty of play.

After all, your uncle&#39;s heritage can&#39;t go to someone who&#39;s employed! With this expansion added to Last Will, each player begins the game with a job card that provides him with a regular income each turn and details a number of things the player must do in order to get fired. Unlike in real life, it can be difficult to persuade your employer to give you the old heave-ho. When you miss work, he&#39;s inclined to be charitable because he liked your uncle and he&#39;s sorry for your loss. To make him angry, you need to get caught living it up when you should be working. He won&#39;t sack you straight away, but he will at least dock your salary. Once per round, you are able to reduce your income by completing one of the things listed on the job card, earning you a demotion. Even your kindly old boss has his limits, though; when you earn enough demotions to cancel out every line of income, you can discard your employment card. Congratulations: You have been sacked and are one step closer to winning the game! You will also have a chance to find yourself a good, demanding wife. A wedding is such a romantic way to spend piles of money in a hurry, right? The expansion has six nuptial cards, so get down on one knee and ask the question!

Now, after more than a generation, a new age dawns with The Cataclysm, an expansion for Talisman Revised 4th Edition. People are returning to establish settlements, nature is evolving in bizarre, unprecendented ways, and traces of the former civilization can be found everywhere. This is a time of chaos and possibility, of challenges and heroism.&nbsp;The Cataclysm introduces a new center board that opens up a reinvented, post-apocalyptic realm for your exploration. Those brave enough to inhabit this world are brought to life in the Denizens deck, while the Remnants deck fills spaces with lost treasures, broken artifacts, and the lingering after-effects of the apocalypse. Five more characters now seek the Crown of Command, including the Black Knight who once menaced the Middle Region, and four alternative endings shape your quests in this ever-changing world.&nbsp;Some of the Characters who first sought the Crown of Command may undertake that quest again in this altered, post-apocalyptic world. Competing with them in The Cataclysm are five others who have never sought it before. Some of them have long inhabited the realm. For instance, the Black Knight has abandoned his castle in the Middle Region to claim greater power. He now rides through Talisman, forcing the other Characters he meets to give him gold or else he&rsquo;ll take one of their lives. The Mutant has also lived in this realm her whole life, and also remained there through its darkest times, but she is not longer the human that she once was. Magical energies that flared and fluctuated during the apocalypse infected her body so thoroughly that her form, Strength, Craft, and fate have continually changed.&nbsp;Others have no memories of what it was like before the apocalypse. The Scavenger grew up during the decades that followed and learned how to survive by staying in motion and collecting whatever Objects she could find. The most valuable ones she stashes away so that they cannot be stolen. Youngest of all is the Arcane Scion , born during the outburst of magical energies that transformed the Mutant. Unlike the Mutant, who cannot fully control her mutations, the Arcane Scion has harnessed those energies, using them to wield Magic Objects and cast Spells.&nbsp; Players 2-6 Suggested ages 13+ Playing time 90 minutes",https://t.cfjump.com/33917/p/35153487,http://www.ozgameshop.com/board-game-expansions/talisman-fourth-edition-the-cataclysm-expansion?utm_source=commission+factory&amp;utm_medium=shopping&amp;utm_campaign=commission+factory+shopping+data+feed+(17/05/2017),http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/35153487.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/35153487@50x50.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/35153487@100x100.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/35153487@120x120.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/35153487@200x200.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/35153487@300x300.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/35153487@400x400.jpg,76.99 AUD,FANTASY FLIGHT GAMES,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These reminiscence cards never enter a player&#39;s deck.",https://t.cfjump.com/33917/p/35228298,http://www.ozgameshop.com/strategy-card-games/tanto-cuore-romantic-vacation?utm_source=commission+factory&amp;utm_medium=shopping&amp;utm_campaign=commission+factory+shopping+data+feed+(17/05/2017),http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/35228298.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/35228298@50x50.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/35228298@100x100.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/35228298@120x120.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/35228298@200x200.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/35228298@300x300.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/35228298@400x400.jpg,84.99 AUD,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

As in the board game, four diseases threaten the world and it&#39;s up to your team to save humanity. You and your team must keep the world&#39;s hotspots in check before they break out of control, while researching cures to the four plagues.&nbsp;Players roll dice each turn to determine the actions available to them. They can fly and sail between the six major population centers of the world, treat disease in their current region, collect samples for further study, and exchange knowledge to help them in their goal of discovering cures. Each player takes on a different role that has its own unique set of dice and abilities &mdash; and players must take advantage of their specializations if they are to have any hope of winning the game. The Dispatcher, for example, can spend dice to fly others around the board, while the Medic is particularly adept at treating disease. Players can roll their dice as often as they like, but the more times they re-roll for the perfect turn, the more likely the next epidemic will occur.&nbsp;At the end of each turn, new &quot;infection dice&quot; are rolled to determine the type and location of newly infected populations. If any region on the board is infected with more than three dice of a given color, an outbreak occurs, spreading disease into an adjacent region.

Each family has a value ranging from 1 to 9, which indicates both the number of cards in the family and the number of victory points the player controlling this family will score at the end of the game.&nbsp;Players reveal their cards in order clockwise from the round&#39;s start player.

She also carries out the powers of any family that she controls, i.e., that she holds more cards of than any other player. The family powers let you protect one family, keep event cards, double the power of an event, steal the first player token, etc. At the end of each round, players discard characters in play (if needed) and discard everything in hand.&nbsp;After eight rounds, players tally their scores based on the families they control, influence scored during the game, and possession of Yi&#39;s Legacy, which is acquired by playing three event cards.

Players then remove their row and capture any of their opponent&#39;s pieces which extend that row. This principle of capturing pieces creates each time again completely changed situations on the board. The purpose is to form successive rows of at least four pieces, until the opponent has no piece left to bring into play. &nbsp; GIPF is not only the name of a game, but of a project as well. This project concerns a group of games and extra pieces that will follow step by step. Each game of the project will be playable either separately, or, by means of extra pieces, in combination with GIPF. It concerns a system that makes winning or losing GIPF-related games a strategic factor of the game GIPF itself. &nbsp; Ages 9 Playing time 30-60 minutes Players 2",https://t.cfjump.com/33917/p/35380516,http://www.ozgameshop.com/strategy-board-games/gipf?utm_source=commission+factory&amp;utm_medium=shopping&amp;utm_campaign=commission+factory+shopping+data+feed+(17/05/2017),http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/35380516.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/35380516@50x50.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/35380516@100x100.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/35380516@120x120.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/35380516@200x200.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/35380516@300x300.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/35380516@400x400.jpg,53.49 AUD,Huch!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The last player to stack a block without making the tower fall wins the game. Gameplay The player who built the tower goes first. Play then passes to the left. On Your Turn Carefully remove a block from anywhere below the highest completed storey. Use only one hand. Then stack the block on top of the tower at right angles to the blocks just below it. Removing and Stacking Blocks Remove and stack one block per turn. Remember &ndash; use only one hand (you can switch hands whenever you wish). As play continues and the weight of the tower shifts, some blocks become looser than others and are easier to remove. You can touch other blocks to find a loose one -- but if you move a block out of place, you must fix it (using one hand only) before touching another block. While stacking, always complete a 3 block storey before starting a higher one. Your turn ends 10 seconds after you stack your block -- or as soon as the player to your left touches one. Keep removing and stacking blocks until someone topples the tower. A real expert can build a tower 36 storeys high or more.

The Golden Dragon has fallen, the Holy Crystal of Psi has shattered, and the old King has drawn his last breath. Worse, Blue Moon, the creator of all things, has vanished and Blue Moon City is left without a ruler. Now the three elemental dragons &ndash; the only divine creatures remaining in the world &ndash; guard the fragments of the Crystal. The two royal heirs, Prince Roland and Princess Elinor, vie for the crown. The peoples of Blue Moon City may not know whom to follow, but whoever can rally them and claim the throne will gain the power to restore the Holy Crystal of Psi and perhaps convince Blue Moon himself to return. Prepare to battle for the throne and restore peace to the city in Blue Moon Legends, a collected version of Blue Moon, Reiner Knizia&#39;s classic card game for two players! In Blue Moon Legends, you will gather the allegiance of one of the peoples of Blue Moon City, then lead them in a series of fights against another people. By winning these fights, you aim to attract the fickle attentions of the elemental dragons and win your way to the throne of the city.

In each round, each player takes one or more turns. On your first turn in a round, you roll all fifteen dice - seven crew dice (brown), three passenger dice (white), and five bad guy dice (black) - then place them in the appropriate places on your display. Crew members and passengers all have unique abilities, some of which involve the option of rerolling dice. After any rerolls, you reveal your mission for the round. If you have dice on your board that match the numbers given at the top of the mission, then you&#39;re unaffected by the bold line - Bushwhacked, Gorram, etc. - immediately underneath. Otherwise, you might be forced to end your go after the current turn, forced to take an additional turn, or affected in some other way. After revealing and resolving the mission, the bad guys strike: Each Badger die holds one supply die. Each Saffron die moves a crew/passenger die of your choice to the cargo hold. If Niska dice are present, KO a crew/passenger die of your choice. After this, you then use any remaining crew and passenger dice to defeat the bad guys, which generally require one point of damage to defeat. Remove them all, and you score 1 VP for each type of bad guy defeated, with half-points for each supply delivered; fail to remove them, and you score no points for the defeated bad guys. If you clear the turn, you can opt to take another turn - rolling all the bad guy dice and all non-KOed crew and passenger dice - or end your turn. If you opt to continue, but then fail to defeat the bad guys, you lose all the VP that you earned previously on that turn. After three rounds, whoever has the most VPs wins.

You overlap with your rivals and fight tooth and nail for fertile planets. Now it is time to extend the horizons. Now it is time to upgrade your ships to the limits of today&rsquo;s technology, and ready them with the brave pilots. Now it is time to go beyond the deep blackness of space into the truly unknown universe&hellip;&nbsp;In Tiny Epic Galaxies: Beyond the Black, players have access to four new ships that they can upgrade their original ships to. To do this, they will need to hire specialized pilots. There are many pilots to hire, each possessing a unique special ability. Pilots are also specialized in what ships they are trained to use. Hiring the right pilot for a ship reduces that pilot&#39;s cost. The more ships a pilot is specialized in, the weaker their special ability is. Pilots are hired by spending unused dice that correspond with the four different ship types, and are worth victory points during play. Pilots are shuffled into a deck and splayed out like planets.&nbsp;Additionally, Tiny Epic Galaxies: Beyond the Black introduces a press-your-luck exploration option for players. This allows players to venture beyond the planets and into deep space where they might encounter dwarf planets worth victory points, or rare materials that yield resources... or they may encounter cosmic threats like solar storms, black holes, and even supernovas. Either way, exploring deep space provides a player with exploration badges. These badges are tallied up at the end of the game and players are rewarded bonus victory points based on who has the most of a certain badge type. They are four types of badges to collect.&nbsp;Tiny Epic Galaxies: Beyond the Black also comes with additional planets and new and exciting secret missions to explore!",https://t.cfjump.com/33917/p/35638348,http://www.ozgameshop.com/strategy-board-games/tiny-epic-galaxies-beyond-the-black?utm_source=commission+factory&amp;utm_medium=shopping&amp;utm_campaign=commission+factory+shopping+data+feed+(17/05/2017),http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/35638348.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/35638348@50x50.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/35638348@100x100.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/35638348@120x120.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/35638348@200x200.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/35638348@300x300.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/35638348@400x400.jpg,39.99 AUD,Gamelyn Games,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

He gathered eminent mediums of his time for an extraordinary s&eacute;ance, and they have seven hours to contact the ghost and investigate any clues that it can provide to unlock an old mystery.&nbsp; Unable to talk, the amnesic ghost communicates with the mediums through visions, which are represented in the game by illustrated cards. The mediums must decipher the images to help the ghost remember how he was murdered: Who did the crime? Where did it take place? Which weapon caused the death? The more the mediums cooperate and guess well, the easier it is to catch the right culprit.&nbsp; In Mysterium, a reworking of the game system present in Tajemnicze Domostwo, one player takes the role of ghost while everyone else represents a medium. To solve the crime, the ghost must first recall (with the aid of the mediums) all of the suspects present on the night of the murder. A number of suspect, location and murder weapon cards are placed on the table, and the ghost randomly assigns one of each of these in secret to a medium.&nbsp; Each hour (i.e., game turn), the ghost hands one or more vision cards face up to each medium, refilling their hand to seven each time they share vision cards. These vision cards present dreamlike images to the mediums, with each medium first needing to deduce which suspect corresponds to the vision cards received. Once the ghost has handed cards to the final medium, they start a two-minute sandtimer. Once a medium has placed their token on a suspect, they may also place clairvoyancy tokens on the guesses made by other mediums to show whether they agree or disagree with those guesses.&nbsp; After time runs out, the ghost reveals to each medium whether the guesses were correct or not. Mediums who guessed correctly move on to guess the location of the crime (and then the murder weapon), while those who didn&#39;t keep their vision cards and receive new ones next hour corresponding to the same suspect. Once a medium has correctly guessed the suspect, location and weapon, they move their token to the epilogue board and receive one clairvoyancy point for each hour remaining on the clock. They can still use their remaining clairvoyancy tokens to score additional points.&nbsp; If one or more mediums fail to identify their proper suspect, location and weapon before the end of the seventh hour, then the ghost has failed and dissipates, leaving the mystery unsolved. If, however, they have all succeeded, then the ghost has recovered enough of its memory to identify the culprit.&nbsp;Mediums then group their suspect, location and weapon cards on the table and place a number by each group. The ghost then selects one group, places the matching culprit number face down on the epilogue board, picks three vision cards &mdash; one for the suspect, one for the location, and one for the weapon &mdash; then shuffles these cards.

If someone leads a color, you must follow suit if you can; otherwise, you can throw off a card or trump the trick.&nbsp;It&#39;s an exact-bidding game, but you predict your tricks by taking colored chips. For each trick that you win, you toss a chip back. If you take a trick in a color for which you didn&#39;t have a chip, then you must take a black chip (worth -3 points). If you have any colored chips left at the end of the round, they&#39;re worth -2 points. If you have any white chips left at the end of the round (wildcards that you get when someone takes a colored chip away from you during bidding), they&#39;re worth -4 points.&nbsp;There&#39;s also the Sluffer, whose role is to feed unwanted tricks to other players. Instead of bidding tricks the Sluffer takes 4 black chips each woth -1 for him at the end of the hand. When players take tricks they didn&#39;t predict, they take black chips from the Sluffer. If the Sluffer feeds enough of the black chips to other players, it can zero out the Sluffer&#39;s score for that round.",https://t.cfjump.com/33917/p/36086749,http://www.ozgameshop.com/party-and-family-board-games/sluff-off?utm_source=commission+factory&amp;utm_medium=shopping&amp;utm_campaign=commission+factory+shopping+data+feed+(17/05/2017),http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/36086749.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/36086749@50x50.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/36086749@100x100.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/36086749@120x120.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/36086749@200x200.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/36086749@300x300.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/36086749@400x400.jpg,21.99 AUD,ASMODEE,,,,,,,,,,,,,18.69 AUD,,,,,,,,

Fortunately for the players, people love to visit wineries, and it just so happens that many of those visitors are willing to help out around the vineyard when they visit as long as you assign a worker to take care of them. Their visits (in the form of cards) are brief but can be very helpful.

Raicer&rsquo;s popular and critically acclaimed Clash of Giants WWI series to two of the storied battles of the American Civil War: Second Bull Run and Gettysburg. CoG: Civil War uses a modified version of the chit-pull Activation system of Clash of Giants II: Campaigns of Galicia and First Ypres, 1914, while retaining the CoG combat system. Every (mostly brigade-level) unit has a Tactical Efficiency Rating based on its morale, training, leadership, and experience, but even a poor unit can have a heroic moment, while the Iron Brigade might not always be made of iron. It is a true player&rsquo;s system, which produces realistic results without a lot of fiddly procedures, and allows players to concentrate on the game rather than the rules. Units in CoG: Civil War are mostly infantry brigades, (with the odd cavalry brigade or demi-brigade). Each day is divided into four day turns and one night turn. The maps depict woods, hills, steep hexsides, railway cuts and embankments, roads, rivers, creeks, bridges, towns, marshy ground, and the Devil&rsquo;s Den at Gettysburg. The Activation rules, which combines random formation activation (mostly corps for the Union and divisions for the Confederates) with variable movement allowances, creates the fog of war and friction so important to Civil War battles. Ordering your corps commander to take a hill is one thing-getting him to act as you wish is another. And because these effects are achieved without hidden counter/dummy unit mechanics, CoG: Civil War is not only a fast-paced two-player game, but excellent as well for solo play. Some Activation markers also allow you to coordinate more than one formation, such as Longstreet at Gettysburg. But don&rsquo;t expect Old Pete to do so early in the day! One thing that speeds play in CoG: Civil War is the unusual treatment of artillery. There are no artillery units depicted; instead artillery appears as Combat Support Markers which are added (attacker first) to the combat strength of engaged units. Artillery CSMs are generally assigned to a specific division or corps, though army reserve artillery can be used to support any units. Artillery cannot be used in combat in certain terrain (woods or town hexes), but there are no line of sight considerations to slow down play or complicate the rules. Instead both line of sight and enemy counter-battery fire are handled with an elegant abstraction: each turn all available artillery CSMs of both sides go into a cup, and then half are randomly drawn. Whatever comes out of the cup is available for use that turn, so the player with more artillery on the field is more likely to get artillery support. This also allows a simple way to model the effectiveness of the Union Artillery Reserve at Gettysburg; once arrived, these markers never go in the cup, and are always available for use. Overall, CoG: Civil War&rsquo;s portrait of artillery as an occasionally decisive but definitely secondary arm is arguabley more realistic than many more complicated designs. The two battles, Second Bull Run and Gettysburg, depict one of Lee&rsquo;s greatest victories, prior to his first invasion of the north, and his greatest defeat during his second invasion. Both are meeting engagements, with limited forces deployed at the start, gradually building to mighty clashes. The arrival of fresh forces is another area where the game system allows variability: units may be delayed or arrive at the wrong road. You can even attempt to speed the arrival of your off-board forces, but at increased risk of their arriving later instead. Winning involves a combination of taking and holding victory hexes, exiting units, and inflicting casualties. You can also earn victory points to compensate for units whose arrival is delayed-but only if you didn&rsquo;t try to force march them to an earlier arrival! Players will have to judge trading losses for taking or holding tactically important ground. Special rules cover such things as General Pope&rsquo;s confused and confusing orders at Second Bull Run, the Confederate grand battery on the third day at Gettysburg, the use of the Union VI Corps as a reserve in both battles, cavalry delaying actions and retreat before combat, rallying units at night, and the actions of certain key leaders. But though there is enough chrome to give each battle a distinctive flavor, the action remains uncluttered, quick-playing, and exciting. Not simply &ldquo;another Civil War battle system,&rdquo; CoG: Civil War presents a fresh new look at an oft-game topic. Giving each side a chance to change history in an afternoon&rsquo;s gaming, the use of the Clash of Giants system also shows the sometimes surprising links between the battles of the Civil War and the opening battles of the Great War 50 years later. Fans of either the Civil War or the Clash of Giants series will not be disappointed.",https://t.cfjump.com/33917/p/36568449,http://www.ozgameshop.com/war-board-games/clash-of-giants-american-civil-war-board-game?utm_source=commission+factory&amp;utm_medium=shopping&amp;utm_campaign=commission+factory+shopping+data+feed+(17/05/2017),http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/36568449.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/36568449@50x50.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/36568449@100x100.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/36568449@120x120.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/36568449@200x200.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/36568449@300x300.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/36568449@400x400.jpg,82.99 AUD,GMT Games,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Can you infect the world?&nbsp;Each player is a deadly disease and they must battle against each other to spread their plagues, develop new symptoms and ultimately wipe out humanity.&nbsp;Starting with Patient Zero, you spread your infection across the world by placing tokens in cities - earning DNA points and preventing other players from becoming dominant. Players choose which countries are placed on the board but you must be both climate resistant and connected to a country before you can infect it. Eventually, as countries become fully infected - you try to kill them using the Death Dice.&nbsp;Each player&rsquo;s unique pathogen can be upgraded by evolving trait cards onto an evolution slide (with DNA points). At the start, your disease is weak and unspecialised, so you will need to add new symptoms to make it stronger. Choose carefully and plan ahead in order to react to the changing world and exploit opportunities created by other player&rsquo;s actions.&nbsp;A simple nosebleed could accelerate things early on, whilst diarrhea will help you thrive in hot countries. Sneezing can infect new continents by air but Total Organ Failure would allow you wipe out multiple countries each turn.&nbsp;As countries start to fall, use powerful event cards to alter the balance of power.

Each company has a double-sided company track, so games will vary quite a lot based on which tracks are revealed and at which companies they are placed.",https://t.cfjump.com/33917/p/37083331,http://www.ozgameshop.com/strategy-board-games/mombasa?utm_source=commission+factory&amp;utm_medium=shopping&amp;utm_campaign=commission+factory+shopping+data+feed+(17/05/2017),http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/37083331.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/37083331@50x50.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/37083331@100x100.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/37083331@120x120.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/37083331@200x200.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/37083331@300x300.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/37083331@400x400.jpg,72.99 AUD,Pegasus Spiele,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Ingenious is an abstract tile-placement game in which the players take turns placing tiles in the shape of two connected hexagons into a hexagonal grid on the board. Each tile has two colored symbols on it. Players earn points in a specific color for each line of matching colored symbols that they extend when they place a tile. A player&rsquo;s final score is determined by his or her lowest scoring color, not the highest. The winner is the player whose lowest score is the highest compared to the other players&rsquo; lowest scores, and not the player with the highest scoring color overall.&nbsp;The game includes 120 domino-style tiles, each consisting of two hexagons connected along one side. Each hexagon has one of six colored symbols in it, with most tiles having two different colored symbols and some having two of the same colored symbol. Each player has a rack with six tiles on it. During his or her turn, each player places one tile from his or her rack onto two empty hexagonal spaces on the game board. For each of the two hexagons composing this tile, the player scores one point in the hexagon&rsquo;s color for each already-placed hexagon of the same color that radiates outward in a straight line from one of the placed hexagon&rsquo;s five sides. If a player&rsquo;s score in a color reaches 18, he or she immediately takes another turn. At the end of the turn, the player refills his or her rack to six tiles.&nbsp;When no more tiles can be placed on the game board or when one player scores 18 in each color, the game ends. Players then compare their lowest scores, and whoever has the highest low score wins.&nbsp;Ingenious includes rules for solitaire and team play.

Players representing different Mayan tribes place their workers on giant connected gears, and as the gears rotate they take the workers to different action spots. During a turn, players can either (a) place one or more workers on the lowest visible spot of the gears or (b) pick up one or more workers. When placing workers, they must pay corn, which is used as a currency in the game. When they pick up a worker, they perform certain actions depending on the position of the worker.

Where once there stood many great powers, there then stood only two. The world had scant months to sigh its collective relief before a new conflict threatened. Unlike the titanic struggles of the preceding decades, this conflict would be waged not primarily by soldiers and tanks, but by spies and politicians, scientists and intellectuals, artists and traitors. Twilight Struggle is a two-player game simulating the forty-five year dance of intrigue, prestige, and occasional flares of warfare between the Soviet Union and the United States. The entire world is the stage on which these two titans fight to make the world safe for their own ideologies and ways of life. The game begins amidst the ruins of Europe as the two new &quot;superpowers&quot; scramble over the wreckage of the Second World War, and ends in 1989, when only the United States remained standing. Twilight Struggle inherits its fundamental systems from the card-driven classics We the People and Hannibal: Rome vs. Carthage. It is a quick-playing, low-complexity game in that tradition. The game map is a world map of the period, whereon players move units and exert influence in attempts to gain allies and control for their superpower. As with GMT&#39;s other card-driven games, decision-making is a challenge; how to best use one&#39;s cards and units given consistently limited resources? Twilight Struggle&#39;s Event cards add detail and flavour to the game. They cover a vast array of historical happenings, from the Arab- Israeli conflicts of 1948 and 1967, to Vietnam and the U.S. peace movement, to the Cuban Missile Crisis and other such incidents that brought the world to the brink of nuclear annihilation. Subsystems capture the prestige-laden Space Race as well as nuclear tensions, with the possibility of game-ending nuclear war. A deluxe edition, published in 2009 includes the following changes from the basic game:&bull; Mounted map with revised graphics&bull; Two double-thick counter sheets with 260 counters&bull; Deck of 110 event cards (increased from 104)&bull; Revised rules and player aid cards&nbsp;",https://t.cfjump.com/33917/p/37201309,http://www.ozgameshop.com/strategy-board-games/twilight-struggle-the-cold-war-1945-1989-deluxe-edition?utm_source=commission+factory&amp;utm_medium=shopping&amp;utm_campaign=commission+factory+shopping+data+feed+(17/05/2017),http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/37201309.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/37201309@50x50.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/37201309@100x100.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/37201309@120x120.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/37201309@200x200.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/37201309@300x300.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/37201309@400x400.jpg,72.99 AUD,B Kids,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The resources of the planet are abundant beyond belief, but are protected vigorously by the indigenous species, known as the Trogs. The riches of the planet will be won, inch by inch, with blood.&nbsp;Cry Havoc is an asymmetric, card-driven area control game for 2-4 players. Each player controls one of the four unique races and fights viciously to gather the most Crystals on the planet, which will more than offset the costs of the conflict. To do this, players must customize their decks of cards, Build powerful Structures, and leverage their unique Skills to gain victory. The indigenous Trogs play a special role in Cry Havoc. In 2- and 3-player games, the Trogs are not controlled by a player, but they act as a deterrent to the invaders&rsquo; aggression. The beginning of the rules contains the explanation of how the Trogs act against the invading races during 2-3 player games. The rules for playing the Trogs in a 4-player game are described at the end of the rulebook.&nbsp;The game is won by the player with the most Victory Points at the end of the game. The primary way to score Victory Points is by controlling Regions with Crystals during Rounds in which Scoring is enabled. Victory Points are also scored for controlling territories, capturing Prisoners, killing enemy Units and using certain Tactics or Skills.&nbsp;",https://t.cfjump.com/33917/p/37259657,http://www.ozgameshop.com/strategy-card-games/cry-havoc?utm_source=commission+factory&amp;utm_medium=shopping&amp;utm_campaign=commission+factory+shopping+data+feed+(17/05/2017),http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/37259657.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/37259657@50x50.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/37259657@100x100.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/37259657@120x120.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/37259657@200x200.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/37259657@300x300.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/37259657@400x400.jpg,102.99 AUD,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The headstrong champion Grungor has arrived. He is always eager to rush into battle, and he has brought with him the priest Tordok who uses defensive runes to protect his fellow Dwarves. Joining them is the vicious fighter Halvor, who would gladly sacrifice himself to land a killing blow on an enemy soldier. These mighty champions are followed by the stoutest of Dwarf warriors known as Guardsmen, whose armor lets them shrug off blows that would fell ordinary folk. And the Dwarves have not stopped there - joining the fray are ancient siege weapons. Dwarven Ballistas are stronger than those employed by other folk - they fire bolts that can punch straight through solid stone! But the Cave Goblin Sneeks has not been idle. He too has drafted new troops to his cause including the opportunistic champions Reeker and Krag, and the frighteningly strange shaman known as Scagg. Strange cries fill the air as Beast Riders swarm from their mountain dens. These Goblins ride strange creatures into battle, quickly overrunning the enemy. Goblin Climbers appear at the highest mountain ridges, firing their bows as they advance. These warriors care little for fortifications, scaling the strongest of walls with ease. And as the Dwarves and Goblins prepare to escalate their ancient war, even stranger warriors appear on the field of battle! The mercenary champion Malevolence offers her magic blade to the highest bidder, and the plague-ridden Vermin will fight for any army that will brave their diseased presence. This reinforcement pack is the perfect addition to your Guild Dwarves vs. Cave Goblins starter set, allowing you to bring new troops to the War for Itharia, and experience the excitement of deck construction.

In 2008, Avalon Hill released a 50th anniversary edition with a new map and cardboard pieces representing the armies and navies.&nbsp;In the game, players represent one of the seven &quot;Great Powers of Europe&quot; (Great Britain, France, Austria-Hungry, Germany, Italy, Russia or Turkey) in the years prior to World War I. Play begins in the Spring of 1901, and players make both Spring and Autumn moves each year. There are only two kinds of military units: armies and fleets. On any given turn, each of your military units has limited options: they can move into an adjoining territory, support an allied unit in an attack on an adjoining territory, support an allied unit in defending an adjoining territory, or hold their position. Players instruct each of their units by writing a set of &quot;orders.&quot; The outcome of each turn is determined by the rules of the game. There are no dice rolls or other elements of chance. With its incredibly simplistic movement mechanics fused to a significant negotiation element, this system is highly respected by many gamers.&nbsp; Players 2-7 Playing time 360 Minutes Ages 12+",https://t.cfjump.com/33917/p/37333525,http://www.ozgameshop.com/strategy-board-games/diplomacy-2017-edition?utm_source=commission+factory&amp;utm_medium=shopping&amp;utm_campaign=commission+factory+shopping+data+feed+(17/05/2017),http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/37333525.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/37333525@50x50.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/37333525@100x100.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/37333525@120x120.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/37333525@200x200.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/37333525@300x300.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/37333525@400x400.jpg,47.99 AUD,Wizards of the Coast,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Each player needs to build an economic engine that surpasses the other by the time railways are established and the foreign markets have been saturated with English cotton.&nbsp;The goal of the game is to have the most points at the end of the game. These are obtained in three ways:&nbsp;1) Building industries and having them successfully utilized&nbsp;2) Building canal or rail connections to cities that have many successfully utilized industries&nbsp;3) money at the end of the game (very inefficient).&nbsp;Game play is divided into two phases - the Canal Phase and the Rail Phase. At the beginning of each phase players are dealt a hand of cards that represent a mix of the cities and the available industries.&nbsp;On his turn, a player has two actions (except first turn of the game where there is only one action) and must spend a card for each one. Available actions include:&nbsp;1) building an industry 2) building a connection [either canals or rails based on phase of the game] 3) developing their own industries which removes lower victory point industries from a player&#39;s board in favor of higher victory point ones 4) selling cotton 5) taking a loan (absolutely necessary a few times a game).&nbsp;At the end of a player&#39;s turn they replace the two cards they played with two more from the deck. Turn order is determined by how much money a player spent on the previous turn - from lowest spent first to highest spent. This turn order mechanic opens some strategic options for players going later in the turn order allowing possibility of back-to-back turns.&nbsp;After all the cards have been played the first time (deck size adjusted for number of players) the Canal Phase ends and a scoring round commences. After scoring, all canals and all of the lowest level industries are removed for the game, new cards are dealt and the Rail Phase begins. Rail Phase is identical to Canal Phase except players may now occupy more than one location in a city and a double connection build (though expensive) is possible. At the end of the Rail Phase there is another scoring round and a winner is crowned.&nbsp;The use of the cards limit where you can build your industries but any card can be used for the develop, sell cotton or building connections actions. This leads to a strategic timing/storing of cards. Resources are common so that if one player builds a rail line (which requires coal) they have to use the coal from the nearest source which may be an opponent&#39;s coal mine which gets that coal mine closer to scoring (i.e. being utilized).&nbsp; Players 3-4 Suggested ages 13 Playing time 120-180 minutes",https://t.cfjump.com/33917/p/37465706,http://www.ozgameshop.com/strategy-board-games/brass-deluxe?utm_source=commission+factory&amp;utm_medium=shopping&amp;utm_campaign=commission+factory+shopping+data+feed+(17/05/2017),http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/37465706.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/37465706@50x50.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/37465706@100x100.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/37465706@120x120.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/37465706@200x200.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/37465706@300x300.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/37465706@400x400.jpg,88.99 AUD,Eagle Games,,,,,,,,,,,,,75.64 AUD,,,,,,,,

The player must drive hostile tribes from the southern plains, establish dominance over the region, set up trade networks with both friendly tribes and colonial powers, and finally defend all of this against relentless military and cultural attack.

The player whose forces collectively have greater control over the surrendered Axis powers will win the peace and the game. Churchill is NOT a wargame, but a political conflict of cooperation and competition. While the game focuses on 10 of the historical conferences from 1943 till the end of the war these and much of this design should not be taken literally. Before and after each conference small groups of advisors and senior officials moved between the Allied capitals making the deals that drove the post war peace. Each conference sees one of a group of issues nominated for inclusion in the conference. The issues categories are: Theater leadership changes, directed offensives, production priorities, clandestine operation s, political activity, and strategic warfare (A-bomb). Each of the historical conference cards independently puts some number of issues such as directed offensives or production priorities metaphorically put on the table, while the players nominate an additional 7 issues. The game display for this is a circular conference table that the three players sit around behind their &#39;seat&#39;. Each player has a staff deck of named personages, such as Secretary Stimson and Anthony Eden that are randomly drawn to make your conference hand. A pre-conference round of cards gives leverage to the winner who then moves an issue toward their side of the table equal to the value of the card played. Play then proceeds with the conference where each player in turn plays a card on one of the issues in the center of the conference table moving it the value of the card toward his side of the table. Each card is an historical personage and they often have bonuses if played on a particular category of issue. Contesting an issue has you move an issue away from an Ally toward your own. At all times each player has his Head of State card (Roosevelt, Churchill, or Stalin) that can weigh in on any issue once per conference by discarding another card. Each use of your personage has a bonus and a potential penalty. Each time Roosevelt is used he may die and be replaced by Harry Truman. Churchill can have a heart attack and miss the next conference, while Stalin&#39;s paranoia may cause a mini-purge and reduce his sides effectiveness for the remainder of the conference. The net result of the conference play is players will &#39;win&#39; various&#39; issues with the player who won the most issues gaining leverage in one of the bilateral global issues (UK versus USSR global issue is Free Europe versus Spheres of Influence). The game then moves into a post conference phase where players implement the issues that they now control. These actions impact three basic game functions: clandestine operations, political activity, and military offensives. Clandestine operations has players try to establish political networks in conquered countries and colonies. Using a very simple mechanic of place a network or remove an opponents network the historical ferment that occurred in Yugoslavia, France and across the world is simply simulated. A country or colony can only have one dominant side&#39;s network at any given time and during political activity players can emplace friendly governments in exile that can be subsequently undermined and replaced if the supporting networks are later neutralized by one of your allies. Once this has all been sorted out the military portion of the game keeps the score. There is a separate display that abstractly represents the major theaters of war, Western, Eastern, Mediterranean, Arctic (Murmansk convoys and Scandinavia), CBI, SW Pacific, Central Pacific, and Far East. Each of these tracks has a Allied front for which I am looking for some kind of 3D tank piece that advance toward Germany, Italy, and Japan. Using a very simple combat mechanic each front tries to advance with Axis reserves deploying to oppose the various fronts. A successful offensive advances the front one space, although with overwhelming superiority a two space breakthrough is possible. Naval operations are simply handled by requiring a defined level of support to advance into an amphibious entry space such as France (D-Day). When a front enters Germany, Italy or Japan they surrender shutting down military operations although clandestine and political activity continue until the end of the game. In the background is the development of the A-bomb and Soviet efforts to steal its secrets. If the A-bomb is available Japan can be forced to surrender sans a direct invasion. As I stated this is not a wargame, but a three player excursion into power politics. The game takes around 3 hours to finish, but I will be including a short and medium scenario. All scenarios end with Potsdam, but you will be able to start later in the war if you only have 1 or 2 hours to play. In addition the game can be played with 3 or 2 players plus solitaire. I am very excited about the new Churchill and large scale playtesting will commence by the end of the month.

A unique multi-faction treatment of the American Revolution, Liberty or Death: The American Insurrection will take 1 to 4 players between lines of clashing red and blue infantry, Indian raids, European politics, British control of the seas, French intervention, and the propaganda war. Building off the good works of COIN Series Creator Volko Ruhnke and Series Designers Jeff Grossman, Brian Train, Mark Herman, and Andrew Ruhnke Designer Harold Buchanan applies his knowledge of the American Revolutionary period to take a new look at the struggle that built a nation. COIN Series Developer Mike Bertucelli continues his work on this project and Volko Ruhnke is an active advisor. Liberty or Death: The American Insurrection features the same card-assisted counterinsurgency game system as GMT&#39;s Andean Abyss, Cuba Libre, A Distant Plain, Fire in the Lake and Gallic War with a set of twists that take the COIN Series to the 18th Century, including: Brilliant Strokes that trump initiative (Led by leaders like Washington, Rochambeau, Clinton and Joseph Brant) Irregular troops (Patriot Militia and Indian War Parties) Regular troops (British and French Regulars and Patriot Continentals) for battles and skirmishes with line infantry Rabble Rousing, Skirmishing, Tories, variable French entry, and Indian Raids Variable impact of naval commitments between the British and French French blockades to confound British plans French financing options to feed the Patriot&rsquo;s war effort A large deck of 110 cards for great play variety Short, medium, and long-length scenarios with period-event or random options. Each faction in Liberty or Death brings new capabilities and challenges: As the British, you have to deal with an Insurrection across a massive region. With control of the seas (at least until the French arrive), you have extreme flexibility and can move across the coast and cities at will. You will muster Tories to support your efforts. They will march with you to battle, but they need your cover. You can control any space you choose, but you cannot answer every threat on the map. The Indians will work with you but, like the Tories, will need you to coordinate and protect them when the Patriots become aggressive. With the leadership of Gage, Howe, and then Clinton, you will be able to strike a potentially decisive Brilliant Stroke if the stars align. Each leader brings something new to the war effort. If you can strike the decisive blow and Win the Day you will be able to build Support and reduce Opposition in short order. If the option to Battle the French in the Colonies presents itself, it will be hard to pass up! As the Patriots, you initially aren&rsquo;t powerful enough to counteract the British Army. You will need to pick your battles and initially spread the Militia to key areas. Over time you can train a force of Continentals to take on the British Regulars. Until then, Rabble-rouse and work with the French to challenge British dominance. Skirmish with the British in small numbers to make their stay expensive. Will the French be there when you need them? Persuade the local population to give you resources to keep the heat up. Watch the Indians on the Frontier because if they develop their forces unanswered you won&rsquo;t be able to win the game regardless of what happens with the British. As the Indian player, you have selected the lesser of two evils in aligning with the British. You will work with them to lower Opposition using Raids but you will be developing your footprint by Gathering forces and building villages. The British can help you to protect them from the Patriots and in return you can assist the British in controlling the region. War Chief Joseph Brant and later War Chief Cornplanter give you the ability to mount a decisive attack with your War Parties but will it be worth exposing your villages to Patriot attack? As the French, you have the ability to be the thorn in the side of the British in North America. With the Hortalez Rodrigue et Cie Company, formed to feed the Patriots resources, you can fund the Insurrection. Your agents can rally assistance in and around Quebec and you can facilitate privateers to steal resources from the British. When you sign the Treaty of Alliance with the Patriots, you can bring French Regulars to America to March and Battle. You can also increase French Naval Intervention, Blockade Cities, move Regulars by sea and Skirmish with the British. As with earlier COIN Series volumes, players of Liberty or Death: The American Insurrection will face difficult strategic decisions with each card. The innovative game system smoothly integrates political, cultural, and economic affairs with military and other violent and non-violent Commands and capabilities. Rabble-rousing, Indian Raids, Persuasion, Naval Pressure, Letter of Marque, Looting, Trading, Skirmishing, and Foraging and more options are available. Flow charts are at hand to run any faction short a player&mdash;solitaire, 2-player, 3-player, or 4-player experiences are equally supported. COMPONENTS A 22&rdquo; x 34&rdquo; mounted game board.

In this game you have multiple paths to win by choosing carefully your actions. Players take turns to perform their actions. Each turn you can do 3 actions (place a realm tile or place one dwarf in a tile or move one dwarf by one tile). Each tile has a pre-requisite of how many dwarfs of one player are needed to perform one kind of action. For example: emerald mines have always three slots, but you will need only two dwarfs to take one emerald. When this task is done (collect one emerald) your two dwarfs will return to your pool. When a player completes three goals (both open and secret goals are taken into account), the endgame begins. Players who had not played this round make their last turn and, then, the game ends. The points are calculated and wins the match who has more points. 2-4 Players 20-60 Min Playing Time Age: 12",https://t.cfjump.com/33917/p/37743170,http://www.ozgameshop.com/party-and-family-board-games/dwar7s-fall-dwarves-fall?utm_source=commission+factory&amp;utm_medium=shopping&amp;utm_campaign=commission+factory+shopping+data+feed+(17/05/2017),http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/37743170.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/37743170@50x50.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/37743170@100x100.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/37743170@120x120.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/37743170@200x200.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/37743170@300x300.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/37743170@400x400.jpg,34.99 AUD,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The Federation&rsquo;s policies are focused around trade and growth, but especially in profit and prosperity for those at the top of the corporate ladder. While they prefer to deal with other star realms using trade and diplomacy, they have a large defense branch dedicated to protecting the Federation&rsquo;s trade and other interests.&nbsp;The Blobs: These mysterious creatures are the first alien life forms encountered by the human race. Most of the initial encounters consisted of human colonies being completely obliterated. On the few occasions that a Blob ship has been recovered somewhat intact, the only biological remains found inside have consisted of a gelatinous mass, thus leading to the moniker, &ldquo;The Blobs&rdquo;. While for several years all encounters between humanity and the Blobs have been extremely violent, there is currently some limited trade between various Blob factions and some of the more daring human traders.The Blobs are best at generating massive amounts of Combat and at removing undesirable cards from the Trade Row.&nbsp;Star Empire: The Star Empire consists primarily of former colonies of the Trade Federation. These colonies were on the outer edges of the Federation. Not only did they feel used by the corporations, but they felt the Federation failed to give them adequate protection from the Blobs. As a result, one ambitious colonial governor was able to unite several colonies into an independent empire under his control, one with a strong military, both for warding off the Blobs and for discouraging the Federation from trying to reclaim their lost colonies. The Star Empire is a combat oriented faction that draws lots of cards and makes the opponent discard cards.&nbsp;Machine Cult: A cluster of industrial mining worlds were completely cut off from the Trade Federation by the Blobs. With the threat of annihilation by the Blobs always looming and no contact with the rest of human space, these worlds were forced to take drastic measures. Soon a cult of technology arose, focused on using advanced technology, robotics and computerization to create strong defenses and a powerful military that belied their relatively small population. Since their leaders believed their salvation lay in technology, technology soon became their god and their religion. The Machine Cult gains most of its power from being able to remove undesirable cards from your deck and from having a large number of Bases designed to defend your Authority from attack.&nbsp;Playing star Realms:&nbsp;When you play Star Realms, you will be able to acquire and use Ships and Bases of any and all of the four factions. Many cards have powerful Ally abilities that reward you for using Ships and Bases of the same faction together, however.&nbsp;As you acquire cards using Trade, you put them into your discard pile, to be later shuffled into your personal deck. When you draw Ships, you do what they say and they get placed into your discard pile at the end of your turn. When you draw a Base, you play it face up in front of you and may use its abilities once every turn. In addition to Combat being the way you reduce your opponent&rsquo;s Authority to zero and win the game, it&rsquo;s also useful for destroying your opponent&rsquo;s Bases. Some Bases are designated as Outposts. Your opponent&rsquo;s Outposts must be destroyed before you can use Combat to attack your opponent&rsquo;s Authority directly.&nbsp;Star Realms is easy to learn, especially if you&rsquo;re familiar with deck-building games, but it&rsquo;s a game that takes time to master. Each time you play, the game is filled with various strategic decision points. Should I take the best card for me or the best card for my opponent? Should I focus on taking cards of a particular faction or on taking the best card available? Should I be focusing on acquiring more Trade or more Combat? Should I attack my opponent&rsquo;s Base or their Authority? These are just some of the many choices you&rsquo;ll be faced with. New players needn&rsquo;t agonize over these choices just to play, but as they become more advanced players, they will find this depth of strategy leads to great replayability.&nbsp; Players 2 Playing time 20 minutes Ages 12+",https://t.cfjump.com/33917/p/37981328,http://www.ozgameshop.com/strategy-card-games/star-realms-deck-building-game?utm_source=commission+factory&amp;utm_medium=shopping&amp;utm_campaign=commission+factory+shopping+data+feed+(17/05/2017),http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/37981328.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/37981328@50x50.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/37981328@100x100.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/37981328@120x120.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/37981328@200x200.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/37981328@300x300.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/37981328@400x400.jpg,38.99 AUD,White Wizard Games,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The game includes ten numbered action tiles, each showing one or more colored ships and with most showing a special action. You shuffle these tiles, place them in a row, then reveal one more than the number of players. On a turn, each player chooses a tile, collects the depicted ships from the reserve, optionally buys or sells one ship, then places the ships on the board. The land has five entryways, and you must start from these points or place adjacent to ships already on the board. You can&#39;t branch the ships being placed, and if you place your first ship adjacent to another, then that first ship must be the same color as the adjacent one; otherwise you can place ships without regard to color. After placing ships, you can either claim colored resources from land that you&#39;ve touched with new ships this turn or build on one vacant space. To build, the space must have colored ships around it that match the ships depicted on one of the available building tiles. If you build a personal building that&#39;s connected to others you own, you receive money equal to the number of buildings. You can bank one ship before the end of your turn, then you can use any three resources or a pair of matching resources to purchase a specialist, each of whom has a unique power. After all players go, you shuffle the action tiles, place them face down in the row, then reveal enough tiles at the front of the line to set up for the next turn, with the turn order being determined by the numbers on the tiles that players chose the previous turn. Once you trigger one of the game-ending conditions e.g., no ships of one color or no more specialists you finish the round, then count points for buildings built, specialists hired, and money on hand.

The set collection aspect of rummy is basically the same, with groups of three cards in either runs or denominations making a valid meld. The twist is that in each hand the number of cards required to create a meld increases, from three cards in the first hand to thirteen in the last. The game, therefore, consists of eleven hands. In each hand, in addition to the six Jokers, other cards are designated as wild: in the first hand 3s are wild; in the second hand 4s are wild, and so on until in the last hand the Kings go wild. (You can remember which cards are wild because it matches the number of cards in hand, i.e., in the first hand you hold three cards and 3s are wild.) A hand ends when a player can meld all cards in her hand after the discard. 2-7 Players 30 Min Playing Time Age: 8",https://t.cfjump.com/33917/p/38467851,http://www.ozgameshop.com/playing-cards/five-crowns-card-game?utm_source=commission+factory&amp;utm_medium=shopping&amp;utm_campaign=commission+factory+shopping+data+feed+(17/05/2017),http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/38467851.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/38467851@50x50.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/38467851@100x100.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/38467851@120x120.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/38467851@200x200.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/38467851@300x300.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/38467851@400x400.jpg,21.99 AUD,999 Games,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

By enduring relentless weather and defeating untamable beasts, players are rewarded with the much-needed tools and food to continually resupply their resources.

Issue #297 1863 is a two player wargame of a pivotal year in the American Civil War. 1863 saw the Union victories at Gettysburg in the east and Vicksburg in the west, and the Chattanooga-Chickamauga campaigns when the Confederates had the opportunity to win a decisive battle and potentially gain foreign recognition.&nbsp;Each player commands one of the two Theater of Operations: East and West. What makes this game unique is that one player commands the Union in the Eastern Theater, and the Confederates in the Western Theater; the second commands the Union in the Western Theater, and the Confederates in the Eastern Theater. Both players are competing to gain the most Victory Points in each Theater while defeating their opponent on the other.&nbsp;The objective of each player is to score the most Victory Points in terms of seizing critical cities and winning battles.

Our Goddess in her infinite wisdom has sent a group of Overseers to protect our world. They have the power to bend human traits to their will, and they will always battle between each other to create the perfect symmetry between virtues and vices of humankind. You will now choose whether to find the best balance &mdash; or completely crush it for your own good. &nbsp; Overseers is a drafting and bluffing game with a twist. Each player represents an Overseer whose objective is to bend traits in their favor to create the most dominant combination of virtues and vices. The game has three main phases:&nbsp; 1] Drafting: Each player receives six cards at random from the deck, selects one of them, then passes the rest to the player sitting on their left. The goal is to build up the combination that will grant them the most victory points. Some cards grant points on their own, while others require the same type of cards to earn more points. &nbsp; 2] Judgement: All players place their five trait cards in front of them in two rows: two face down and three face up to show the cards they chose. Give the information available, the Overseers then discuss which player has the strongest possible combination. After deliberating, players vote for this person using their token. The chosen player must then admit or deny the verdict:&nbsp; &mdash; If they admit having the strongest combination, they must then discard two cards from their combination. &mdash; If they deny this, the showdown phase happens, with all players revealing their scores. If the chosen player has the strongest combination, they lose the two cards that grant the most points; if not, instead they take one additional card of their choice from the discard pile. &nbsp; 3] Scoring: Each player shows all cards in front of them, then calculates their score. &nbsp; The game might have other phases depending on the type of overseers being played as each character has special abilities that can change the outcome of the game, such as being able to peek at another player&#39;s hidden cards, steal a card before the scoring phase, or transform one card into another. &nbsp; At the end of each round, players secret their victory point (VP) tokens to keep their score secret, and after three rounds whoever has the most VPs wins. &nbsp; Players 3-6 Playing time 30-45 mins Ages 12",https://t.cfjump.com/33917/p/39068749,http://www.ozgameshop.com/strategy-card-games/overseers?utm_source=commission+factory&amp;utm_medium=shopping&amp;utm_campaign=commission+factory+shopping+data+feed+(17/05/2017),http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/39068749.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/39068749@50x50.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/39068749@100x100.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/39068749@120x120.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/39068749@200x200.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/39068749@300x300.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/39068749@400x400.jpg,39.99 AUD,Greenbrier Games,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Contents: 100 Cards 1 Rulebook Setting Up a Game: At the beginning of the game each player is dealt 10 cards face down. These cards form each player&rsquo;s Life Deck. Players can never look at the cards in their Life Deck unless the game or a card effect allows them to. Playing the Game: The game is played in a series of rounds. During each round, players take turns in trying to summon cards. A round ends when only one player remains, making that player the winner of that round. A new round then begins. At the end of the round, each eliminated player will take damage, which is represented by discarding cards from their Life Deck. If you are eliminated and have no cards in your Life Deck, then you are defeated and are out of the game. The last player remaining in the game wins! The Turn: The player who was randomly chosen to go first takes the first turn of the opening round. On your turn, you must try to summon a card. Initially, you&rsquo;ll try to summon a card from the Draw Deck, but as the game progresses you might be able to summon cards from your reserves as you accumulate them. To summon a card from the top of the Draw Deck, reveal that card. If its strength is greater than the strength of the last card you summoned, then you&rsquo;ve successfully summoned that card. Place it to the right of the last card you summoned. This is known as Escalating. If you summoned the card successfully, you may use any Summon ability that it may have; though using it is entirely optional. If the card&rsquo;s strength is not greater than the last card you summoned, then discard the card you drew from the Draw Deck, and you are eliminated from the round. Discard any other cards you summoned this round. After a player summons a card, or fails to summon a card, play passes to the player with the lowest total strength among their summoned cards. If there is a tie, and the current player is one of the tied players, then the current player takes the next turn. Otherwise, play passes to the next player to their left that is tied for lowest. If the Draw Deck runs out of cards, shuffle the cards in the discard pile to make a new Draw Deck. Ending the Round: A round ends when only one player remains in the round. The winning player adds up the damage values of their summoned cards. Each &lsquo;Red dot&rsquo; on a summoned card represents a single damage point. Each opponent takes that much damage, starting with the player to the winner&rsquo;s left, and going around the table. Once each player has taken their damage from their Life Deck, the winner discards their summoned cards and becomes the starting player for the next round. The Life Deck: Whenever you take damage, draw that many cards from your Life Deck and choose one of them to go to your reserves. Discard the other cards. If you&rsquo;re out of cards while drawing, you are still in the game &mdash; you don&rsquo;t get defeated until you take damage while having no cards in your Life Deck. If an ability allows you to gain life, put that many cards from the Draw Deck on top of your Life Deck without looking at them. The Reserves: Whenever you place a card in your reserves, put it next to your Life Deck so you don&rsquo;t confuse it with the cards you summon during the round. If the card has a Reserve ability, you may play it now. Whenever you must summon a card, you may choose to summon one from your reserves instead of revealing a card from the Draw Deck. You can choose any card with strength greater than the last card you summoned this round and put it to the right of that card. If it has a Summon ability, you may play it &mdash; play then passes per the normal rules. Abilities: Most abilities on cards have a keyword that tells you when to play that ability. Playing summon, reserve, and aftermath abilities are always optional. Summon: Play this when you successfully summon the card. Reserve: Play this when the card is placed into your reserves, regardless of where it came from. Aftermath: Play this when you are eliminated from a round or at the end of the round that you won. Cards have special abilities that do not fall under any other ability category are considered to be &ldquo;always on,&rdquo; even while they are in your reserves. These abilities are not optional. Telling the Fortune: Once the game is over, if the winner had any cards left in their Life Deck, they use those cards to divine the future. That player shuffles those cards and lays them out, face-up, one at a time. The first card represents the present, the second represents the immediate future, and the rest divine the far future. It&rsquo;s up to the players to interpret what those cards mean.",https://t.cfjump.com/33917/p/39552944,http://www.ozgameshop.com/strategy-card-games/dread-draw-board-game?utm_source=commission+factory&amp;utm_medium=shopping&amp;utm_campaign=commission+factory+shopping+data+feed+(17/05/2017),http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/39552944.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/39552944@50x50.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/39552944@100x100.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/39552944@120x120.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/39552944@200x200.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/39552944@300x300.jpg,http://c.cfjump.com/Products/11793/39552944@400x400.jpg,32.99 AUD,Upper Deck,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
